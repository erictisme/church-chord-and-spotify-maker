# It Is Well With My Soul x 10,000 Reasons

[Verse 1 - It Is Well]
C                 F      Dm7  G7        C
When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
Am           D7              G    G7
When sorrows like sea billows roll,
C          F                     D7                G7
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
C              F         C    G7    C
It is well, it is well with my soul.

[Chorus - It Is Well]
C              F         C
It is well with my soul,
               G    G7    C
It is well, it is well with my soul.

[Verse 2 - It Is Well]
C                 F      Dm7  G7        C
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Am           D7              G    G7
Let this blest assurance control,
C          F                     D7                G7
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
C              F         C    G7    C
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

O my soul,

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
G                    Am
It's time to sing Your song again.

Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,

Let me be singing when the evening comes.
