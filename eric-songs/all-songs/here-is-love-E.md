              E                                A
here is love, vast as the ocean
              E                            B
loving kindness as the flood
                    E                                A
When the prince of life, our ransom

shed for us his precious blood
                  E                              B
who his love will not remember
                  F#m                         E
who can cease to sing his praise?
              C#m               A
he will never be forgotten
                         E                    B       E
throughout heavens eternal days

[Verse 2]
              E                          A
on the mount of crucifixion
                     E                              B
fountains opened deep and wide
                         E                                   A
through the floodgates of God's mercy
                     E              B               E
flowed a vast and gracious tide
                     E                              B
grace and love like mighty rivers
                    F#m                  E
poured incessant from above
                           C#m                          A
and heavens peace and perfect justice

kissed a guilty world in love

Let me all Thy love accepting
                       E                    B
Love Thee, ever all my days
              E                                   A
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
                 E         B           E
And my life be to Thy praise
                 E                            B
Thou alone shall be my glory
            F#m                        E
Nothing in the world I see
                     C#m                                    A
Thou has cleansed and sanctified me
                    E                 B          E
Thou Thyself hast set me free

who his love will not remember
                 F#m                           E
who can cease to sing his praise?
             C#m                   A
he will never be forgotten
                        E               B            E
throughout heavens eternal days

here is love, vast as the ocean
               E                            B
loving kindness as the flood

When the prince of life, our ransom
