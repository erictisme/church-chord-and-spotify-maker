CAPO 2

[Intro]
Em  D  C x4

[Verse 1]
Em   D C   G                    C    G                           D
Here I am, humbled by your majesty covered by your grace so I'm free
Em   D C   G                      C    G                         D
Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man covered by the blood of the Lamb
Em    D     G                        Em D  G                              A
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine since you laid down your life
                    C
The greatest sacrifice

[Chorus]
G     D  Em   C           G                          D
Majesty, Majesty - Your grace has found me just as I am
        Em                        C
Empty handed, but alive in your hands
G     D  Em    C     G                            D
Majesty, Majesty - Forever I am changed by your love
        Em                 C
In the presence of your Majesty

[Verse 2]
Em   D C   G                              C   G                         D
Here I am, humbled by the love that you give, forgiven so that I can forgive
Em   D C       G                        C     G                      D
Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire, sanctified by glory and fire
Em    D     G                        Em D  G                               A
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine since you laid down your life
                    C
The greatest sacrifice

**CHORUS** x2
