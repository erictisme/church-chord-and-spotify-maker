# There is a Fountain

Em C G G

[Verse 1]
G             C             G
There is a fountain filled with blood
Em           Am7   D7
Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
G                             C             G
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
G          Am7 D7 G
Lose all their guilty stains:
G7      C
Lose all their guilty stains,
G       Em7 Am7 D7
Lose all their guilty stains;
G                              C              G
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
G         Am7 D7      Em C G G
Lose all their guilty stains.

[Verse 2]
G                C             G
The dying thief rejoiced to see
Em        Am7  D7
That fountain in his day.
G                              C        G
And there may I, though vile as he,
G           Am7  D7 G
Wash all my sins away:
G7                 C
Wash all my sins away,
G      Em7 Am7  D7
Wash all my sins away;
G                              C         G
And there may I, though vile as he,
G      Am7   D7  Em C G G
Wash all my sins away.

[Verse 3]
G                         C            G
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Em    Am7         D7
Shall never lose its pow'r,
G                          C              G
Till all the ransomed Church of God,
G          Am7 D7  G
Be saved to sin no more:
G7                      C
Be saved to sin no more,
G   Em7 Am7     D7
Be saved to sin no more,
G                         C              G
Till all the ransomed Church of God,
G       Am7 D7  Em C G G
Be saved to sin no more.

[Verse 4]
G                    C          G
E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Em       Am7           D7
Thy flowing wounds supply,
G                         C             G
Redeeming love has been my theme
G        Am D G
And shall be till  I  die:
G7               C 	      G         Em Am D
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die,
G                         C             G
Redeeming love has been my theme
G        Am D        Em C
And shall be till  I  die.
