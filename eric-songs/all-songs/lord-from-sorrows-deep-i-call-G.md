# Lord From Sorrows Deep I Call

[Verse 1]
G/B        C       D      Em7
Lord, from sorrows deep I call
G/B     Cmaj7   Em   D
When my hope is shaken
G/B      C      D        Em7
Torn and ruined from the fall
C       Am7   D G
Hear my desperation
D                G/B      C
For so long I've pled and prayed
Am7        G/B   Em    D
"God, come to my rescue"
G/B  C       D       Em7
Even so, the thorn remains
C        Am7        D      C2
Still my heart will praise You

[Verse 2]
G/B        C     D        Em7
Storms within my troubled soul
G/B       Cmaj7  Dsus  D
Questions without answers
G/B   C           D       Em7
On my faith these billows roll
C       Am7    D   G
God, be now my shelter
D                G/B      C
Why are you cast down, my soul?
Am7     G/B     Em    D
Hope in Him who saves you
G/B      C          D         Em7
When the fires have all grown cold
C          Am7      D      G
Cause this heart to praise You

[Chorus]
D                     C       G
Oh, my soul, put your hope in God
   D/F#     Em           C      G
My Help, my Rock, I will praise Him
D        G/B               C   D     Em
Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
       Am7      G/B        C
You're still my God, my Salvation

[Verse 3]
G/B       C       D         Em7
Should my life be torn from me
G/B   Cmaj7   Dsus D
Every worldly pleasure
G/B      C    D       Em7
When all I possess is grief
C       Am7     D   G
God, be then my treasure
D           G/B     C
Be my vision in the night
Am7   G/B      Em    D
Be my hope and refuge
G/B     C        D         Em7
Till my faith is turned to sight
C        Am7        D      G
Lord, my heart will praise You

**CHORUS**

[Final Chorus]
D      G/B            C       G
Oh, my soul, put your hope in God
   D/F#     Em           C      G
My Help, my Rock, I will praise Him
D        G/B               C    D    Em
Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
       Am7      G/B        C
You're still my God, my Salvation
