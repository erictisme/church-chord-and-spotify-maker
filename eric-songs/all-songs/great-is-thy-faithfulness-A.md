Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father!

Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not:

As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness!

Morning by morning, new mercies I see;

All I have needed Thy hand hath provided,
B#dim                     A                         E7                  A
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!
