[Verse]

              A                                          D
Let the King of my heart, be the mountain
              A
where I run
            F#m                E               D              A
The fountain I drink from, oh He is my song
             A                                            D
Let the King of my heart, be the shadow
              A
where I hide
         F#m                   E                D        A
The ransom for my life, oh He is my Song

[Chorus]
               F#m   E         D      A
You are good, good, o - h
              F#m    E         D      A
You are good, good, o - h

[Verse]
              A                                          D
Let the King of my heart, be the wind inside
       A
my sails
          F#m                E                     D         A
The anchor in the waves, oh He is my song
              A                                         D
Let the King of my heart, be the fire inside my
A
veins
       F#m              E                 D          A
The echo of my days, oh He is my song


[Chorus]

               F#m   E         D      A
You are good, good, o - h
              F#m    E         D      A
You are good, good, o - h
               F#m   E         D      A
You are good, good, o - h
              F#m    E         D      A
You are good, good, o – h
