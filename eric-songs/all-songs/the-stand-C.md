# The Stand

[Verse 1]
C
You stood before creation
                        F
Eternity in Your hand
                        Am
You spoke the earth into motion
                     F
My soul now to stand

[Verse 2]
C
You stood before my failure
                          F
And carried the cross for my shame
                   Am
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
                    F
My soul now to stand

[Chorus]
       C              G
So what can I say and what could I do
       Am            F
But offer this heart O God
                C             G
Completely to You

[Verse 3]
C
So I'll walk upon salvation
                             F
Your Spirit alive in me
                      Am
This life to declare Your promise
                    F
My soul now to stand

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
           C                G
So I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
       Am              F
In awe of the One who gave it all
       C             G
I'll stand my soul Lord to You surrendered
Am                 F
All I am is Yours

**BRIDGE** (repeat multiple times)

**CHORUS**
