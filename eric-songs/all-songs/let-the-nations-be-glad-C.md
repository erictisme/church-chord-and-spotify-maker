# Let the Nations Be Glad

[Intro]
C   F   C   F

[Verse 1]
            C
Let the glory of the Lord forever be our
joy
                                                           G      F
May redemption be the theme of our song
           C
For by grace we have been saved

And by grace we shall proclaim
             C                    G
To the corners of the earth that Christ
        F    G
has come

[Chorus]
              F               C                  F     G
Let the nations be glad, let the people
    Am
rejoice
        F                  C                G
For salvation belongs to our God
                        F           C
Let the whole earth be filled with the
   F       G       Am
praises of the Lord
           F              C                 G
For salvation belongs to our God
             F  G              C F C F
Let the nations be glad

[Verse 2]
                    C
Through the ages gone before

Through the trial and the sword

Many saints and martyrs conquered though
         G    F
they died
                 C
Still we're holding out the cross

Crossing oceans suffering loss
        C                              G
Shall endure all things to win the crown
     F    G
of life

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
             C
As your holy church goes forth, in the
Holy Spirit's power
                                                           G
With the glories of the Gospel to explain
 F
              Am
Now we pray Your kingdom come
             G/B                     C
And we pray Your will be done
              F                   G
For the honor and the glory of Your
   Am
name

**CHORUS** x2 (first time till 2nd last line)
