# I Will Follow

[Intro]
F C F C

[Verse 1]
F         	 C
When the sea is calm and all is right
F                       C
When I feel Your favor, flood my life
Am        G      F
Even in the good, I'll follow You
Am        G         C
Even in the good, I'll follow You

[Verse 2]
F                        C
When the boat is tossed upon the waves
F             C
When I wonder if You'll keep me safe
Am        G      F
Even in the storms, I'll follow You
Am        G     C
Even in the storms, I'll follow You

[Chorus]
G                                C  C/E    F
I believe everything that You say You are
G                                       C    C/E F
I believe that I have seen Your unchanging heart
C                       Em                 Am  G
In the good things and in the hardest part
F      G      Am
I believe and I will follow You
F       G     C
I believe and I will follow You

[Verse 3]
F            C
When I see the wicked prospering
F                      C
When I feel I have no voice to sing
Am        G         F
Even in the want, I'll follow You
Am        G        C
Even in the want, I'll follow You

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4] SOFT
F           		C
When I find myself so far from home
F           		        C
And You lead me somewhere I don't wanna go
Am (HINT)   G      F
Even in my death, I'll follow You
Am        G      F
Even in my death, I'll follow You

[Verse 5] BUILD
F           	       C
When I come to end this race I've run
F                             C
And I receive the prize that Christ has won
Am     G      F
I will be with You in Paradise
Am     G      C F C/E F
I will be with You in Paradise

**CHORUS** x2
