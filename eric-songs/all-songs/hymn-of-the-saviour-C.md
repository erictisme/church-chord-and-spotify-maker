# Hymn of the Saviour

[Intro]
F Am C2 C2

[Verse 1]
Am       F
From the chaos of darkness
C               G
Your word shaped the earth
Am      F      C
In your image a people made
Am        F
But we traded perfection
C           G
The truth for a lie
Am        F         C
And your glory was veiled in shame

[Verse 2]
F       C
But a promise made
G            Am
A blessing you gave
F      C       G
To a people of your name
F      C
For this broken world
Em          Am
A saviour foretold
F            G
To bear all our grief and pain

F  Am C C x2

[Verse 3]  Build Up
Am       F
When the heavenly saviour
C          G
Descended his throne
Am         F         C
All my sin on his shoulders laid
Am        F
And to win our redemption
C            G
He suffered and died
Am         F         C
For the sake of my guilt and shame

[Verse 4]
F        C
Oh the price he paid
G         Am
In taking my place
F         C   G
so that death was overcome
F       C
For the king of love
Em             Am
Burst forth from the grave
F            G
Proclaiming the victory won

F  Am C C x2

[Verse 5] (Soft)
Am         F
At the end of the ages
C            G
The world passed away
Am         F         C
I will gaze on my saviour's face
Am          F
When my heart is perfected
C       G
Free from my sin
Am           F        C (build)
I will rest in your glorious grace

Build to top

[Verse 6]
F       C
For the song we raise
G            Am
The works of our hands
F       C      G
Are in service of the king
F        C
When a thousand tounges
Em       Am
Cry "Glory to God"
F        G            F
Forever his praise we'll sing
F       C
For the song we raise
G            Am
The works of our hands
F       C      G
Are in service of the king
F        C
When a thousand tounges
Em       Am
Cry "Glory to God"
F        G            Am
Forever his praise we'll sing
F        G            F
Forever his praise we'll sing
Am C C
F Am C End
