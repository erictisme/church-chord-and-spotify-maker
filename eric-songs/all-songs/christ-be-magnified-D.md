# Christ Be Magnified

[Intro]
D…   A. Gadd9…. X2

[Verse 1]
D                         Gadd9
Were creation suddenly articulate
D                                      Gadd9
With a thousand tongues to lift one cry
D/F#                     Gadd9
Then from north to south and east to west
Asus      A                      D A Gadd9
We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'

[Verse 2]
D                                Gadd9
Were the whole earth echoing His eminence
D                                          Gadd9
His name would burst from sea and sky
D/F#               Gadd9
From rivers to the mountain tops
Asus     A        D
We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'

[Chorus]
D                 D2/E   G
O! Christ be magnified!
A        Bm
Let His praise arise
A       G
Christ be magnified in me
D                     D2/E   G
O! Christ be magnified!
A    Bm
From the altar of my life
A        G       A           D A Gadd9
Christ be magnified in me

[Verse 3]
D                           Gadd9
When every creature finds its inmost melody
D                             Gadd9
And every human heart its native cry
D/F#                    Gadd9
O then in one enraptured hymn of praise
Asus              Gadd9
We'll sing 'Christ be magnified!'
Gadd9
O be lifted high, Jesus

**CHORUS**

G   A   Bm   D/F#

[Bridge]
G
I won't bow to idols
A
I'll stand strong and worship You
Bm
And if it puts me in the fire
D/F#
I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too
G
I won't be formed by feelings
A
I hold fast to what is true
Bm
If the cross brings transformation
D/F#
Then I'll be crucified with You
G
'Cause death is just the doorway
A
Into resurrection life
Bm
And if I join You in Your suffering
D/F#
Then I'll join You when You rise
G
And when You return in glory
A
With all the angels and the saints
Bm
My heart will still be singing
A
And my song will be the same
