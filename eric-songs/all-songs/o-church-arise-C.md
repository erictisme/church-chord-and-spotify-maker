# O Church Arise

[Intro/Interlude]
C Bb F G#

[Verse 1]
G7sus              C                            F/A     G
O church, arise and put your armor on;
               C         F             Gsus C
Hear the call of Christ our captain;
       G7sus   C                            F/A      G
For now the weak can say that they are strong
          C                   F             Gsus C
In the strength that God has given.
                       F                   C       G
With shield of faith and belt of truth
               C    F           C  Am   G
We'll stand against the devil's lies;
     G7sus C                   F/A    G
An army bold whose battle cry is "Love!"
               C           F         Gsus C
Reaching out to those in darkness.

**INTERLUDE**

[Verse 2]
G7sus     C                F/A     G
Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
         C       F          Gsus C
But to rage against the captor;
    G7sus   C                 F/A      G
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
        C            F       Gsus C
We will fight with faith and valor.
               F         C       G
When faced with trials on ev'ry side,
      C       F     C   Am  G
We know the outcome is secure,
   G7sus C                 F/A    G
And Christ will have the prize for which He died—
         C      F        Gsus C
An inheritance of nations.

[Chorus]
  G                     F        C
Arise, shine for Your light has come
  G                   F    C
Arise shine for the Risen Son
      Am         G                  F      C
Lift Your eyes, we are His radient bride
 Dm       G      C
Arise O Church arise

**INTERLUDE**

[Verse 3]
G7sus     C                F/A     G
Come, see the cross where love and mercy meet,
         C       F          Gsus C
As the Son of God is stricken;
    G7sus   C                 F/A      G
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
        C            F       Gsus C
For the Conqueror has risen!
               F         C       G
And as the stone is rolled away,
      C       F         C  Am   G
And Christ emerges from the grave,
   G7sus C                 F/A    G
This vict'ry march continues till the day
         C      F        Gsus C
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him.

[Verse 4]
G7sus     C                F/A     G
So Spirit, come, put strength in ev'ry stride,
         C       F          Gsus C
Give grace for ev'ry hurdle,
    G7sus   C                 F/A      G
That we may run with faith to win the prize
        C            F       Gsus C
Of a servant good and faithful.
               F         C       G
As saints of old still line the way,
      C       F         C  Am   G
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
   G7sus C                 F/A    G
We hear their calls and hunger for the day
         C      F        Gsus C
When with Christ we stand in glory
