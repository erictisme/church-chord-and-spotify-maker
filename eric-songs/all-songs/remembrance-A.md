# Remembrance

[Intro]
A    Bm7  Dadd9
F#m  E    Dadd9   {A}

[Verse 1]
A            Bm7      Dadd9
  I take the bread of life
F#m          E      D
  Broken for all my sin
A           Bm7  Dadd9
  Your body crucified
F#m          E      A
  To make me whole again

[Verse 2]
A          Bm7      Dadd9
  I will recall the cup
F#m             E     D
  Poured out in sacrifice
A               Bm7      Dadd9
  To trade this sinner's end
F#m            E   A
  For Your new covenant

[Chorus]
     D
Hallelujah
A                       E
I'll live my life in remembrance
     D
Hallelujah
     A                   E
Your promise I won't forget

[Verse 3]
A              Bm7      Dadd9
  I'll walk salvation's road
F#m             E    D
  With fear and trembling
A                Bm7   Dadd9
  Your way borne as my own
F#m            E         A
  As Christ is formed in me

[Chorus] (Clar)
     D
Hallelujah
A                       E
I'll live my life in remembrance
     D
Hallelujah
     A                   E
Your promise I won't forget

[Chorus 2]
   D
If ever I should lose my way
   E
If ever I deny Your grace
  F#m                   A/C# D
Remind me of the price You   paid
     Bm7
Hallelujah
     E
I'll live in remembrance

[Interlude]
A   E   F#m  D

[Bridge] x3
            A               E
You've been so, so good to me
            F#m             D
You've been so, so good to me
       A                    E
Oh, to think where I would be
           F#m
If not for You
   E       D
If not for You

[Chorus 3]
   D
As far as heights reach from the depths
   E
As far as east is from the west
   F#m                   A/C# D
So far Your grace has carried me
  D
Until I see You face to face
  E
Until at last I've won my race
  F#m                   A/C#   D
Remind me You're not finished yet

[Outro]
     Bm7   E
Hallelujah
     Bm7   E
Hallelujah
     Bm7
Hallelujah
     E             A
I'll live in remembrance
