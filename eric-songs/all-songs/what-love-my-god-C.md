[Verse 1]
                       C                F
What love my God would bring you down to
C
earth
       F                                                     C
What king would take a low and lonely birth
       F                                      Am
Yet to this dark and broken place you came
                     C           G
To sleep beneath the stars that you had
C / / / C / / /
 made

[Verse 2]
                       C                 F                     C
What love my God would send the Way of Life
                   F                                 C
To walk the road, rejected and despised
                          F                                Am
That you might know the weakness I possess
                  C               G              C
And be my rock of strength and righteousness

[Chorus]
            F                            C
O Your love my God like a flood
                    G               Am
As heaven opened up pouring out on us
                    F                                   C
O praise the King who came to the world
           G
In his love like a mighty flood

**INTRO**

[Verse 3]
                        C               F                      C
What love my God could hold you to the tree
                      F                                  C
To bear that overwhelming debt for me
                     F                                         Am
The Son of heaven leaves the Father's side
                    C               G                          C
The Healer bleeds, the Life was made to die

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
                        C           F
What love my God, so gracious and
       C
extreme
                       F
Was strong enough to come and fight for
   C
 me
                       F                                  Am
To go through hell and down into the grave
                      C       G                      C
And raise me up to see you face to face
                      C       G                        C
You raise me up to see you face to face

**CHORUS** x2
