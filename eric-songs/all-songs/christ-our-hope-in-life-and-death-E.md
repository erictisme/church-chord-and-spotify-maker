Christ alone, Christ alone.

What is our only confidence?

That our souls to Him belong.

Who holds our days within His hand?

What comes, apart from His command?

And what will keep us to the end?

God is good, God is good.

In our great Redeemer's blood.

Who stands above the stormy trial?

Who sends the waves that bring us nigh
A         E/B           B          E
Unto the shore, the rock of Christ?

When Christ is ours forevermore.
