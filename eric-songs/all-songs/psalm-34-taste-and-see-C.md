# Psalm 34 (Taste and See)

[Verse 1]
                  C          F        C
I sought the Lord and He answered me
              G  F          C
And delivered me from every fear
                  C       F    C
Those who look on Him are radiant
                   G      F                C
They'll never be ashamed, They'll never be ashamed

             C              F         C
This poor man cried and the Lord heard me
             G   F        C
And saved me from my enemies
           C        F         C
The son of God surrounds his saints
                G   F                  C
He will deliver them, He will deliver them

[Chorus]
     Am     F         C
Magnify the Lord with me
     Am    F           C  G
Come exalt His name together
    Am      F         C
Glorify the Lord with me
     Am    F        C   G
Come exalt His name forever

[Verse 2]
             C            F       C
Oh taste and see that the Lord is good
              G  F            C
Oh blessed is He who hides in him
            C        F       C
Oh fear the Lord all of you saints
                     G   F                    C
He'll give you everything, He'll give you everything

**CHORUS**

Never ending praise, May our incense rise
