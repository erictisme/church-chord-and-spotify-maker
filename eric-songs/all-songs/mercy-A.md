# Mercy - Matt Redman (A)

## Verse 1
```
       A                    E/G#
I will kneel in the dust
           Bm7          A/C#
At the foot of the cross,
              F#m  Esus E    Asus
Where mercy paid for me.

                                    E/G#
Where the wrath I deserve,
       Bm7             A/C#
It is gone, it has passed.
       F#m          Esus E   Asus
Your blood has hidden me.
```

## Chorus
```
F#m    D2
Mercy, mercy,
     E                       A
As endless as the sea.
      F#m        D2
I'll sing Your hallelujah
           Eadd4  A
For all eternity.
```

## Verse 2
```
             A              E/G#
We will lift up the cup
             Bm7                A/C#
And the bread we will break,
F#m7        Esus       E    Asus
Remembering Your love.

               E/G#           Bm7
We were fallen from grace,
              A/C#            F#m
But You took on our shame
        Esus             E       Asus
And nailed it to a cross.
```

## Bridge
```
A                                F#m
May I never lose the wonder,
              D2                     E
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy.
           F#m         D2
May I sing Your hallelujah.
Bm             E
Hallelujah, Amen.

I will kneel in the dust
           Bm7          A/C#
At the foot of the cross,
              F#m  Esus E    Asus
Where mercy paid for me.
