# Your Word

[Intro]
Em C G x2

[Verse 1]
Em           C       G
Your word is good, it's ever faithful
Em        C             G
Worth more than gold, the heart's delight
Em                C               G
Your word gives life to all who hear and obey
Em                   C              G   D*
Your word endures forever

[Verse 2]
Em         C         G
Your word is true, it never changes
Em          C         G
It formed the earth; sustains it still
Em          C          G
Your word defends; providing refuge and strength
Em                  C               G   D
Your word endures forever

[Chorus]
Em                    C                    G      D

Em                     C                   G      D
Your word is a light unto my path
Em                  D                G               C
For your word is my hope, it's my joy and my song

Em          C             G
Your word transforms, it lifts the humble
Em         C                G
Rebukes the proud, protects the poor

Em            C             G
Your word discerns the mind and spirit of all
Em                  C                G     D
Your word endures forever
Em                  C                G     D
Your word endures forever

It's treasures are endless, it's always enough
C                                             D
Your word is more than just stories of old
Em                                    D
It's the truth and the way and the story of love
C                                          D
Your word is more than just breath into dust
Em                                    D
It's your Son, as a man, come to dwell here with us
