# Blessed Assurance

Interlude
Am F C G

[Verse 1]
                        C        F       C
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
                      Am Em             D7             G  G7
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
 C                           F                   C
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Am                       Dm         G7               C
        Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood


[Chorus]
G7                     C        F               C
        This is my story, this is my song,
                    F    Am D7               G
Praising my Saviour, all the day long,
G7                      C   F                   C
        This is my story, this is my song,
Am                      Dm    G7                C
        Praising my Saviour, all the day long.

Am F C G

[Verse 2]
                           C  F                  C
Perfect submission, perfect delight!
           Am   Em D7                             G  G7
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
             C                F                        C
Angels descending bring from above,
Am                   Dm         G7           C
        Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

**CHORUS**

Am F C G

[Verse 3]
                     C        F           C
Perfect submission, all is at rest,
               Am  Em     D7           G  G7
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
                          C      F                   C
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Am                          Dm    G7                    C
       Filled with His goodness, lost in His love

**CHORUS**
