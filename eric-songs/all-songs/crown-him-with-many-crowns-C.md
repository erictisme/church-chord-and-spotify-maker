# Crown Him with Many Crowns

[Verse 1]
C                                   F
Crown Him with many crowns
        C           F           G7
The Lamb upon His throne
         C                         D           G
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
      G       Dsus4   G
All music but its own
  C                              F
Awake, my soul, and sing
     D                          G
Of Him who died for thee
        C            F          G7          C
And hail Him as thy matchless King
              F        G7         C
Through all e-ter-ni-ty

[Verse 2]
C                                    F
Crown Him the Lord of life
        C               F             G7
Who triumphed o'er the grave
       C                      D         G
And rose victorious in the strife
       G          Dsus4        G
For those He came to save
       C                      F
His glories now we sing
         D                        G
Who died and rose on high
         C      F        G7       C
Who died eternal life to bring
         F             G7            C
And lives that death may die

[Verse 3]
 C                                 F
Crown him the Lord of love;
        C         F              G7
behold his hands and side,
      C                        D         G
rich wounds, yet visible above,
     G     Dsus4     G
in beauty glorified;
      C                  F
no angels in the sky
        D                    G
can fully bear that sight,
        C               F               G7    C
but downward bends their burning eye
         F    G7        C
at mysteries so bright.

[Verse 4]
C                                      F
Crown him the Lord of years,
     C          F        G7
the potentate of time,
     C                 D           G
creator of the rolling spheres,
     G    Dsus4   G
ineffably sublime.
     C                      F
All hail Redeemer, hail
       D                             G
For Thou hast died for me
       C               F       G7          C
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
              F   G7     C
Through-out eter-nity
