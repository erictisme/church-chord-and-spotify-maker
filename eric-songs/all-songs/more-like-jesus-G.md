# More Like Jesus

G  G  C  C

[Verse 1]
    G
You came to the world You created
C
Trading Your crown for a cross
    Em
You willingly died
     D                          C
Your innocent life paid the cost

[Verse 2] (MITCH)
G
Counting Your status as nothing
    C
The King of all kings came to serve
Em
Washing my feet
Dadd4                     C
Covering me with Your love

[Chorus]
   G                   G/B
If more of You means less of me
     C2
Take ev'rything
     G               G/B
Yes, all of You is all I need
     C2
Take ev'rything

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3] (MITCH)
G
You are my life and my treasure
    Cmaj7
The One that I can't live without
Em
Here at Your feet
      Dadd4                 C   D
My desires and dreams I lay down
Em
Here at Your feet
     Dadd4                   C
My desires and dreams I lay down

[Chorus] x2
   G                   G/B
If more of You means less of me

Take ev'rything

Yes, all of You is all I need

Take ev'rything

[Bridge] x2

Here with my heart in Your hands
                      C2        Dsus D
Father I pray make me more like Jesus
     G                              Cmaj7
This world is dying to know who You are
                    Dsus        Em7
You've shown us the way to Your heart
                         C2        Dsus D
So Father I pray make me more like Jesus

C D C D C
