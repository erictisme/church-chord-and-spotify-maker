# He Will Hold Me Fast

[Intro] x2
G

[Verse 1]
G          G/B                     C
When I fear my faith will fail,
 D       G
Christ will hold me fast;
                 G/B       C
When the tempter would prevail,
         D       G
He will hold me fast.
Em      D     G       C
I could never keep my hold
                B        Em
Through life's fearful path;
       D       G     C
For my love is often cold;
         D       G
He must hold me fast.

[Chorus]
C       D       Em
He will hold me fast,
       D/F#     G
He will hold me fast;
G      Am           Am7  C
For my Savior loves me so,
         D       G
He will hold me fast.

[Verse 2]
G                  G/B   C
Those He saves are His delight,
            D       G
Christ will hold me fast;
                 G/B  C
Precious in His holy sight,
         D       G
He will hold me fast.
Em        D      G       C
He'll not let my soul be lost;
         B         Em
His promises shall last;
          D      G      C
Bought by Him at such a cost,
         D       G
He will hold me fast.

**INTRO** x2

[Verse 3]
G              G/B      C
For my life He bled and died,
            D       G
Christ will hold me fast;
                 G/B   C
Justice has been satisfied;
         D       G
He will hold me fast.
Em          D      G       C
Raised with Him to endless life,
         B       Em
He will hold me fast
          D        G         C
'Till our faith is turned to sight
         D        G
When He comes at last!
