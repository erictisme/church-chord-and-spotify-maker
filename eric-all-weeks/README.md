## Instructions

**Eric: Upload all your ~100+ weeks of worship documents into this folder.**

### What to Upload:

- ✅ ANY format that contains chord charts
- ✅ Keep original filenames (dates will be extracted automatically)

### What to Skip:
- ❌ Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- ❌ PDF files (.pdf) - these are harder to parse

### After Upload:
Once you've uploaded everything, I will:
1. Read each document manually
2. Extract every song with clean formatting
3. Save each song to the `eric-songs/` folder
4. Remove duplicate songs (keeping the latest version)
