# He Lives

[Intro]
G G4 G G4 G G4

[Verse 1]
G G4 x3
I serve a risen Savior, He's in the world today;
G           F#/D Em         A7            D7
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;
G G4 x3
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,
        A7                                           D
And just the time I need Him, He's always near.

[Chorus]
   G     G4    G     G4        Cadd9           G
He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
      D7                         G                       A7
He walks with me and talks with me, along
                    D7
life's narrow way.
      G   G4    G G4     Cadd9         B
He lives, He lives, Salvation to impart!
       E7                  A7                           G
You ask me how I know He lives? He lives
D7             G
within my heart.

[Verse 2]
G G4 x3
In all the world around me I see His loving care,
        G         F#/D Em           A7       D7
And though my heart grows weary I will never despair;

G G4 x3
I know that He is leading through all the stormy blast,
       A7                                    D
The day of His appearing will come at last.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
G
Rejoice, rejoice O Christian, lift up your voice and sing
   G       F#/D Em        A7                      D7
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!
G
The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find,
          A7                             D
None other is so loving, so good and kind.

**CHORUS**
