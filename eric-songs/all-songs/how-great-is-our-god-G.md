# How Great Is Our God

[Intro]
G Em C D

[Verse 1]
       G                                 Em7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                          C2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
       G                                       Em7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                                C2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

[Chorus]
          G
How great is our God, sing with me,
        Em7
How great is our God, all will see,
           C                D             G
How great, how great is our God.

[Verse 2]
 G                                      Em7
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                              C2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
         G                                 Em7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                              C2
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
G                                  D/F#
Name above all names,
Em7                         D/F#
Worthy of all praise,
         C
My heart will sing
           D                G
How great is our God. x2

**CHORUS**
