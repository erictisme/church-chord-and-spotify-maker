## Song 1: Indescribable (E)

[Verse 1]
C#m                                 Bsus/D#     E   E2
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
F#m              F#m7/E             D
Creation's revealing Your majesty
C#m                              Bsus/D#      E      E2
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
F#m                           F#m7/E           D
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
A     B
All exclaiming

[Chorus]
E                    Bsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
A2                                              C#m
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                   A2
You are amazing God
E  E2           Bsus
All powerful, untameable,
A2                                             C#m
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
E/G#             A2
You are amazing God

[Verse 2]
C#m                                Bsus/D#         E   E2
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
F#m                    F#m7/E                 D
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
C#m                              Bsus/D#         E     E2
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
F#m                        F#m7/E                 D
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
A        B
None can fathom

[Chorus] x2
E                    Bsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
A2                                                    C#m
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                         A2
You are amazing God
E     E2             Bsus
All powerful, untameable,
A2                                             C#m
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
E/G#             A2
You are amazing God
E                    Bsus
Incomparable, unchangeable
A2                                                  C#m
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
E/G#               A2
You are amazing God
                 A2
You are amazing God

## Song 3: Living Hope (D)

[Intro]
D G D G

[Verse 1]
              D                A
How great the chasm that lay between us
             G        Bm            A
How high the mountain I could not climb
        D                              A
In desperation I turned to heaven
                            G      A            D
And spoke Your name into the night
                              G
Then through the darkness Your loving kindness
D
Tore through the shadows of my soul
                    Bm                   A
The work is finished, the end is written
             G              A         D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

Who could imagine so great a mercy
                              G          Bm
What heart could fathom such boundless grace
A
The God of ages stepped down from glory
                    A
To wear my sin and bear my shame
                    G           A             D
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
                         G                      D
The King of Kings calls me His own

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope x2

(D) G

[Verse 3]
              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        D
Declared the grave has no claim on me

              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        Bm  (D/F#)
Declared the grave has no claim on me
       G            A    D
Jesus, Yours is the victory

**CHORUS** x2

      G          A      Bm    D/F#
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope
      G          A      Bm    D/F#
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope
