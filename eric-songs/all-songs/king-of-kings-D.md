## Verse 1
```
       F#/D                G
In the darkness we were waiting
        A            D
Without hope without light
          D               G
Till from heaven You came running
          A              D
There was mercy in Your eyes
   D                  G
To fulfil the law and prophets
      A              D
To a virgin came the Word
       D                 G
From a throne of endless glory
      A            D
To a cradle in the dirt
```

```

## Verse 2
```
   D                  G
To reveal the kingdom coming
        A            D
And to reconcile the lost
   D                 G
To redeem the whole creation
         A              D
You did not despise the cross
    D             G
For even in Your suffering
        A            D
You saw to the other side
        D                G
Knowing this was our salvation
      A                D
Jesus for our sake You died
```

## Chorus

## Verse 3
```
        Bm               G
And the morning that You rose
        A              D
All of heaven held its breath
          Bm                  G
Till that stone was moved for good
        A                  D
For the Lamb had conquered death
        Bm                   G
And the dead rose from their tombs
        A               D
And the angels stood in awe
        Bm                 G
For the souls of all who'd come
        A            D
To the Father are restored
```

## Verse 4
```
        D                    G
And the Church of Christ was born
         A              D
Then the Spirit lit the flame
         D               G
Now this gospel truth of old
          A               D
Shall not kneel shall not faint
       D                G
By His blood and in His Name
        A            D
In His freedom I am free
                      G
For the love of Jesus Christ
         A          D
Who has resurrected me
```
