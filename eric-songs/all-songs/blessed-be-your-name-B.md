# Blessed Be Your Name

[Verse 1]
B                        F#
Blessed be your name in the land that is plentiful
          G#m                         E
Where your streams of abundance flow, blessed be your name
B                            F#
Blessed be your name when I'm found in the desert place
            G#m                        E
Though I walk through the wilderness, blessed be your name

[Pre-Chorus]
B                   F#
Every blessing you pour out I'll
G#m                  E
Turn back to praise
B                        F#
When the darkness closes in Lord
G#m          E
Still I will say

[Chorus]
B                      F#
Blessed be the name of the Lord
G#m                    E
Blessed be your name
B                      F#
Blessed be the name of the Lord
G#m                E       B
Blessed be your glorious name

[Verse 2]
B                         F#
Blessed be your name when the sun's shining down on me
          G#m                      E
When the world's all as it should be, blessed be your name
B                        F#
Blessed be your name on the road marked with suffering
            G#m                      E
Though there's pain in the offering, blessed be your name

**PRE-CHORUS**

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
B                                  F#
You give and take away, you give and take away
   G#m                              E
My heart will choose to say, Lord blessed be your name (x2)

**CHORUS** x2
