     A
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories

Of what they think You're like
      A
But, I've heard the tender whisper
    A
Of love in the dead of night
         D      A/C#
And You tell me that You're pleased
         Bm          E
And that I'm never alone

It's who You are

Oh, and I've seen many searching

For answers far and wide

But I know we're all searching

For answers only You provide

Cause You know just what we need

Before we, say a word
