## Verse 1
```
               E
This alabaster jar
                 B/D#
is all I have of worth
                   C#m7
I break it at Your feet, Lord
                   A
It's less than You deserve
                E
You're far more beautiful
                       B/D#
More precious than the oil
              C#m7
The sum of my desires
                       A
and the fullness of my joy
```

## Pre-Chorus
```
         C#m7
Like You spilled Your blood,
  A                    C#m7
I spill my heart as an offering
      B7
to my King
```

## Chorus
```
       E        B/D#
Here I am , take me
      C#m7  A
As an offering
       E            B/D#       C#m7
Here I am , giving every heartbeat
         A          E
For Your glory take me
```

## Verse 2
```
                      E
This time that I have left
                       B
is all I have of worth
                               C#m7
I lay it at your feet Lord,
                             A
its less than you deserve.
                                     E
And though I've little strength,
                                      B
and though my days are few,
                                  C#m7
You gave your life for me
                         A
so I will live my life for you.
