# Thy Kingdom Come

C Am G C (Main chord pattern for verses)

[Verse 1]
C               Am
Pass not the cup from me
G             C
If I do thy will
C                         Am                   G
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
                               C
Where my blood is spilled
C               	  Am
Make my heart brave
G              C      Am                      G
Make my back strong enough to carry my
C
 Cross
C                         Am                          G
For what I've gained for my own pride
                 C
I count as loss

G F C G G G G
Oh~

[Verse 2]
C                Am
May my life be poured out
G                   C
Upon the feet of the poor
C                Am
May orphans call me father
G                   C
And may I never lock my doors
C                Am
May I never lose hope
G               C
Upon the darkest night
C         Am
May my life be a seed
G                C
And my spirit light

G F C G G G G (Strings)
Oh~

[Verse 3]
C                  Am
May those that come behind
G                  C
Not linger at my grave
C            Am
Plant me beside the waters
G              C
And may I offer shade
C                         Am                   G
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
                    C
On heaven and earth
C                Am
May my life be poured out
G                 C
And my death give birth

[Refrain]
G F C G G G G
Oh~

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On heaven and earth
May my life be poured out
And my death give birth
