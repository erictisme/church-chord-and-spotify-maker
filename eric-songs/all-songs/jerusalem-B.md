# Jerusalem

[Intro]
A D A E

[Verse 1]
A                     D     A
See Him in Jerusalem
A                             E         A
Walking where the crowds are
A                                   D            A
Once these streets had sung to him
A                         E     A
Now they cry for murder
A          D            F#m    E
Such a frail and lonely man
              D         A        E
Holding up the heavy cross
                 D             A E   F#m
See him walking in Jerusalem
D                     E       A
On the road to save us

A D A E

[Verse 2]
A             D                        A
See him there upon the hill
A                               E    A
Hear the scorn and laughter
A               D             A
Silent as a lamb He waits
A                      E    A
Praying to the Father
A            D            F#m         E
See the king who made the sun
  D           A                         E
And the moon and shining stars
             D           A             E        F#m
Let the soldiers hold and nail him down
D                         E        A
So that he could save them

A D A E

[Verse 3]
A                      D             A
See him there upon the cross
A                      E       A
Now no longer breathing
A                                D               A
Dust that formed the watching crowds
A                             E   A
Takes the blood of Jesus
A              D         F#m           E
Feel the Earth is shaking now
              D       A         E
See the veil is split in two
             D         A             E            F#m
And he stood before the wrath of God
D                          E           A
Shielding sinners with his blood

[Verse 4]
A                      D         A
See the empty tomb today
A                          E           A
Death could not contain him
A                           D            A
Once the servant of the world
A                     E      A
Now in vict'ry reigning (Wait 4)

       D      A      E
Who is seated on the throne

See him in the new Jerusalem) x2

Praise the one who saved us (2nd time)
D                  E     A
Praise the one who saved us (2nd time)
