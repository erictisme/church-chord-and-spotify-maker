# Psalm 23 (Clarissa) - G

Intro:
C  |   G  |   C  D  G

VERSE 1:
         C                  D                     G
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want
C                          D                         G
In green pastures He makes me lie down
              C          D
He restores my soul
        Em  D     C  Bm     Am
and leads me  on for His Name
                         D
For His great Name

CHORUS:
            C                         G
Surely goodness, surely mercy
           C                          G
Right beside me all my days
                   C                                  G
And I will dwell in Your house forever
         C                D       G
And bless Your Holy Name

VERSE 2:
C                       D                  G
You prepare a table right before me
C                       D                G
In the presence of my enemies
                     C       D
Though the arrow flies
             Em     D   C      Bm     Am
and the terror of night is at my door
                      D
I'll trust you Lord

CHORUS:
            C                         G
Surely goodness, surely mercy
           C                          G
Right beside me all my days
                   C                                  G
And I will dwell in Your house forever
         C                D       G
And bless Your Holy Name

BRIDGE:
                         C
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
                      G
I will fear no evil
                         C
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
                         G
You are on my side x2

SOFT CHORUS
