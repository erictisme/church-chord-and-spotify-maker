Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth
D    A/D    Bm  G
Delivered up

But safe in the plan of God

But by men denied

[Pre-Chorus]
      Em                                              G
The promised one has suffered and died
      Em      D                          C       G A
The gift of forgiveness has arrived

[Chorus]
    D       G               A
Christ is risen and reigning
        Bm           G                    A
The gospel is spreading and saving
       D            G                     A              Bm
The Spirit is poured out and giving new life
 A G A
 to us
D          G              A
Go and tell of the wonders of
Bm              G                 A
God who is calling and claiming
       D                G                    A
His message is sent out and reaching the

 world through us

Good news of peace
 D              A/D   Bm                 G
Nailed to a tree, now we have witnessed him
 D        A/D       Bm  G
Raised up and free

[Pre-Chorus]
      Em                                 G
Anointed with the Spirit and power
      Em                                       D    A
Appointed to be judge of all the world
