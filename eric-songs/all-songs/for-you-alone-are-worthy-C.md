# For You Alone Are Worthy - C

[Just Piano]

Verse 1:
             C                     G
When I feel I can't go on
                 C                                 G
With this crushing weight; I'm done
                  Am   Em
And I feel all alone;
            C                   G
Even though I've known
                                C                        D
That You've been near me all this while

[Guitar strumming]
                            C                     G
Trapped in my pride I can't let go
                  C                       G
But in despair I see the truth
               Am              Em
Only in You there's hope;
                    C          G
Trusting in You alone
                      C    D      G
God you are my deliverer


Chorus:
                       C
And when the darkness comes
                         G
My heart will know no fear
                              C          D        G
Your outstretched hand delivers me.
                   C
And I will sing you a song
                    Em
With every breath comes praise
                 C             D         G
For you alone are worthy, Lord


Verse 2:
                      C                    G
Out of the depths I cry out Lord
                        C                       G
Now with my own eyes I can see
                       Am               Em
You are my strength my shield
                       C             G
Your hope in me revealed
                     C       D   G
God you are my redeemer


Chorus:
                       C
And when the darkness comes
                         G
My heart will know no fear
                              C          D        G
Your outstretched hand delivers me.
                   C
And I will sing you a song
                    Em
With every breath comes praise
                 C             D         G
For you alone are worthy, Lord


Bridge:
[Softly at first]
                    C                   G
And I say "You are my god"
                 C           G
I trust in you, O Lord

[build up]
                      Am
You are my comforter
                      Em
My portion forever
                     C       D       G
Great is the glory of the Lord


Final Chorus:
                       C
And when the darkness comes
                         G
My heart will know no fear
                              C          D        G
Your outstretched hand delivers me.
                   C
And I will sing you a song
                    Em
With every breath comes praise
                 C             D         Em
For you alone are worthy, Lord
                 C             D         G
For you alone are worthy
