# Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus

D G D G

[Verse 1]
D                      G        D
Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
G       A
And to take him at his word
D              G        D
Just to rest upon his promise
Bm        G               Asus      D
And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

[Chorus]
D                 G      A
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
D                               G        A
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Bm              G            D
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
Bm    Em       Asus         D
O for grace to trust him more!

[Verse 2]
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust his cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me
'neath the healing, cleansing flood!

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
G                        C          G
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
C         D
Just from sin and self to cease
G                        C        G
Just from Jesus simply taking
C         Dsus      G
Life and rest, and joy and peace

[Chorus in G]
G             C      D
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
G                  C        D
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
G              C       G
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
C        D        G
O for grace to trust him more!

[Verse 4]
I'm so glad I learned to trust thee
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend
And I know that thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end

**CHORUS**
