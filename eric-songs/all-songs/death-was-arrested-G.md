# Death Was Arrested

[Intro]
| G \ \ Cadd9 |
| G \ \ Cadd9 |

[Verse 1]
 G                     Cadd9      G
Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin
Em                        D          G
Lost without hope and no place to begin
     G                      Cadd9      G
Your love made a way to let mercy come in
     Em                       D       G
When death was arrested and my life began

[Verse 2]
G                      Cadd9     G
Ash was redeemed, only beauty remains
      Em                   D        G
(and) My orphan heart was given a name
   G                        Cadd9        G
My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance
     Em                     D         G
When death was arrested and my life began

[Chorus]
        Cadd9    G           Em   D
Oh Your grace so free washes over me
         Cadd9            Em               D
You have made me new, now life begins with You
          Cadd9    G           Em       D
It's Your endless love pouring down on us
         Cadd9            Em               D
You have made us new now life begins with You

[Verse 3]
  G                           Cadd9       G
Released from my chain, I'm a prisoner no more
    Em                     D         G
My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore
   G                       Cadd9          G
He canceled my debt and He called me His friend
     Em                      D        G
When death was arrested and my life began

**CHORUS**

Cadd9

[Verse 4]
    G                      Cadd9      G
Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross
      Cadd9                        D         Em
(and) Darkness rejoiced as though Heaven had lost
          G                    Cadd9      G
But then Jesus arose with our freedom in hand
            Em                     D         G
That's when death was arrested and my life began

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
         G              Cadd9      G
Oh we're free, free, forever we're free
Em                    D         G
Come join the song of all the redeemed
          G              Cadd9 G
Yes we're free, free, forever amen
     Em                     D         G
When death was arrested and my life began

         G              Cadd9      G
Oh we're free, free, forever we're free
Em                    D         G
Come join the song of all the redeemed
          G              Cadd9 G
Yes we're free, free, forever amen
     Em                     D         G
When death was arrested and my life began

[Outro]
     Em                     D         G
When death was arrested and my life began
            Em                     D         G
That's when death was arrested and my life began
