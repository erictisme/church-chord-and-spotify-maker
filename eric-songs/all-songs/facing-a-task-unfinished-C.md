# Facing A Task Unfinished

[Verse 1]
    C              G
Facing a task unfinished
       F        G       C
That drives us to our knees
   C             F
A need that, undiminished
   Dm                 G
Rebukes our slothful ease
     C               F   C
We, who rejoice to know Thee
  Am              Dm
Renew before Thy throne
       C              F
The solemn pledge we owe Thee
   Dm      G          C
To go and make Thee known

[Verse 2]
        C            G
Where other lords beside Thee
       F       G       C
Hold their unhindered sway
        C            F
Where forces that defied Thee
 Dm               G
Defy Thee still today
       C                 F  C
With none to heed their crying
     Am                   Dm
For life, and love, and light
   C                  F
Unnumbered souls are dying
     Dm    G        C
And pass into the night

[Chorus]
   G               C
We go to all the world
       G             C
With kingdom hope unfurled
    F     G         Em      Am
No other name has power to save
     Dm     G         C
But Jesus Christ The Lord

[Verse 3]
    C                   G
We bear the torch that flaming
      F        G         C
Fell from the hands of those
          C                      F
Who gave their lives proclaiming
       Dm                    G
That Jesus died and rose
      C            F  C
Ours is the same commission
     Am                Dm
The same glad message ours
       C             F
Fired by the same ambition
    Dm       G         C
To Thee we yield our powers

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4 Soft]
   C            G
O Father who sustained them
    F     G     C
O Spirit who inspired
   C                     F
Saviour, whose love constrained them
   Dm                G
To toil with zeal untired
      C          F     C
From cowardice defend us
      Am        Dm
From lethargy awake!
       C                F
Forth on Thine errands send us
    Dm    G        C
To labour for Thy sake

**CHORUS** x2
