# Name Above All Names

C#m7  A2   E   B

[Verse 1]
E                                         A2
From the brightness of His glory
E                              A2
Jesus the Son of God descends
E                                       A2
Takes on the nature of a servant
E                   A2
Jesus, obedient to death
F#m7                                 B
The Father willed to crush Him
E       B/D#     C#m7
As a sacrifice for sin
F#m7                         B
He satisfied God's justice
C#m7   A2     B
And in victory rose again

[Chorus]
C#m7             A2
You are highly exalted
E
Name above all names
B
Worthy of all praise
C#m7                      A2
You are reigning in glory
E
Jesus, You're the King
B
Over everything

A2                  E              B
Exalted to the highest place
F#m7         A2       B                              C#
Given the name above all other names

C#m7   A2   E   B

[Verse 2]
E                                               A2
The tomb is empty, Christ has risen
E                                    A2
Jesus, the Lamb, once crucified
E                                A2
The angels never cease to worship
E                        A2
Jesus, in heaven glorified
F#m7                       B
To Him belongs the power
E              B/D#              C#m7
The wisdom, might, and strength
F#m7                    B
All glory and dominion
C#m7      A2     B
To the Lord of every age

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
A2
Our knees will bow
C#m7
Our tongues proclaim
A2                     E
That You are Lord of all x2

**CHORUS**
