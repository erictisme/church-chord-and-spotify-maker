[Verse 1]

Grace and peace, oh how can this be

For lawbreakers and thieves, for the
Am               F
worthless, the least
C                                   Am
You have said that our judgment is death
G                            Am                 F
For all eternity without hope, without rest
F                  Am   G          F
Oh, what an amazing mystery,
Am        G   F

The matchless King of all paid the blood

price for me
C                                       Am
Slaughtered lamb, what atonement You bring!

The vilest sinner's heart can be

cleansed, can be free
F                   Am    G    F

Let songs of gratefulness ever rise,

My heart is satisfied in the riches of
