F#m             D          A
I'm the one who held the nail
       F#m                            E                   D
It was cold between my fingertips
     F#m           D    A
I've hidden in the garden
       F#m                               E         D
I've denied You with my very lips
```

God, I fall down to my knees with a hammer in my hand
    A                Esus4
You look at me, arms open
```

```
   A         Esus4
Forgiven, forgiven
F#m                  A       D
Child, there is freedom from all of it
F#m            Esus4
Say goodbye to every sin

You are forgiven

I've done things I wish I hadn't done
          F#m              E                          D
I've seen things I wish I hadn't seen
         F#m              D        A
Just the thought of Your amazing grace
    E/G#   F#m              E         D
And I cry "Jesus, forgive me"
```

## Pre-Chorus

You look at me, arms open
```

Say goodbye to every sin
           F#m   D   A
You are forgiven
```

## Bridge
```
F#m
  I could've been six feet under
D
 I could've been lost forever
A
 Yeah, I should be in that fire
C#m7
   But now there's fire inside of me
F#m
  Here I am a dead man walking
D
 No grave gonna hold God's people
A
 All the weight of all our evil
C#m7
   Lifted away, forever free
D
 Who could believe, who could believe
```

## Chorus 2
```
   A         E/G#
Forgiven, forgiven
    F#m                         D
You love me even when I don't deserve it
   A             E/G#
Forgiven, I'm forgiven
F#m                  A     D
Jesus, Your blood makes me innocent
          F#m            Esus4
So I will say goodbye to every sin
        F#m   D   A
I am forgiven
        F#m   D   A
I am forgiven
```
