# Hosanna

[Verse 1]
G
I see the King of glory
Em
Coming on the clouds with fire
                Am
The whole earth shakes
                D
The whole earth shakes

G
I see His love and mercy
Em
Washing over all our sin
          Am
The people Sing
          D
The people sing

[Chorus]
G        C       D        Em
Ho - sanna, Ho - san - na
C                           Em       D
Hosanna in the Highest
G        C       D        Em
Ho - sanna, Ho - san - na
C                           D        Em
Hosanna in the High - est

[Verse 2]
G
I see a generation
Em
Rising up to take the place
Am              D
With selfless faith, with selfless faith

G
I see a near revival
Em
Staring as we pray and seek
Am              D
We're on our knees, we're on our knees

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
 C                          D
Heal my heart and make it clean
 G                       Em
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
 C                        D             Em
Show me how to love like You have loved me
C                               D
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
 G                        Em
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
 C                         D          C
As I walk from earth in - to eterni - ty

**CHORUS**

[Ending]
C                           D        Em
Hosanna in the High - est
C                           D        G
Hosanna in the High - est
