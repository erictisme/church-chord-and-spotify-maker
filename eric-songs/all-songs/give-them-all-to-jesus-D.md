# Give Them All To Jesus
**Key: D**

## Verse
```
D                                Em
  Are you tired of chasing pretty rainbows?

A                                        D
 And are you tired of spinning 'round and 'round?

D                                    Em
 Wrap up all the shattered dreams of your life

A                                   D
 And at the feet of Jesus lay them down
```

## Chorus
```
           D              F#m      G                         A
Give them all, give them all,      give them all to Jesus

           Em                                   A                 D
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts and broken toys  G A

             D              F#m    G                  A
Give them all, give them all,     give them
           A
all to Jesus
         G                  A           D
And He will turn your sorrow into joy

## Verse
```
D                              Em
 He never said, you'd only see sunshine

A                              D
 He never said, there'd be no rain

D                                 Em
 He only promised a heart full of singing

A                                         D
 About the very things that once brought pain
