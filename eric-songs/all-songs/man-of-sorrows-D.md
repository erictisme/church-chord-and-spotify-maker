## Verse 1
```
D                                 G                  D
Man of sorrows Lamb of God
G                 D        A
By His own betrayed
Bm                         G                   Bm
The sin of man and wrath of God
              G              A           D
Has been on Jesus laid

D                            G           D
Silent as He stood accused
G                     D              A
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bm                 G             Bm
Bowing to the Father's will
           G              A               D
He took a crown of thorns
```

## Chorus
```
                  Bm           G
Oh that rugged cross

My salvation

Where Your love poured out over me
                     G                    D
Now my soul cries out
            A    Bm
Hallelujah
                           G              A        D

## Verse 2
```
D                                   G            D
Sent of heaven God's own Son
           G                 D        A
To purchase and redeem
Bm                 G             Bm
And reconcile the very ones
           G              A               D
Who nailed Him to that tree
```

                     Bm          G
Now my debt is paid
            D              A
It is paid in full
                     Bm          G
By the precious blood
            D              A
That my Jesus spilled
                     Bm          G
Now the curse of sin
            D              A
Has no hold on me
                     Bm          G
Whom the Son sets free
            D              A
Oh is free indeed

D                                   G            D
See the stone is rolled away
G                 D        A
Behold the empty tomb
Bm                      G                   Bm
Hallelujah God be praised

He's risen from the grave
