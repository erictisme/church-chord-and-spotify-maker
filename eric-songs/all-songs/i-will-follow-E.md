# I Will Follow

[Intro]
A/E E A/E E

[Verse 1]
                       A2/C#          	 E
When the sea is calm and all is right
                            A2/C#           E
When I feel Your favor, flood my life
                    C#m        B      A
Even in the good, I'll follow You
                   C#m        B      E
Even in the good, I'll follow You

[Verse 2]
                             A2/C#          E
When the boat is tossed upon the waves
                        A2/C#             E
When I wonder if You'll keep me safe
                        C#m        B      A
Even in the storms, I'll follow You
                        C#m        B     E
Even in the storms, I'll follow You

[Chorus]
           B                                E  E/G# A
I believe everything that You say You are
         B                                       E    E/G# A
I believe that I have seen Your unchanging heart
            E                       G#m            C#m
In the good things and in the hardest part
                       A      B      C#m
I believe and I will follow You
                       A       B     E
I believe and I will follow You

[Verse 3]
                         A2/C#            E
When I see the wicked prospering
                      A2/C#              E
When I feel I have no voice to sing
                   C#m        B      A
Even in the want, I'll follow You
                   C#m        B      E
Even in the want, I'll follow You

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4] (Soft)
               A2/C#           E
When I find myself so far from home
               A2/C#           E
And You lead me somewhere I don't wanna go
               C#m (HINT)   B      A
Even in my death, I'll follow You
                    C#m        B      A
Even in my death, I'll follow You

[Verse 5] (Build)
                          A2/C#           E
When I come to end this race I've run
                             A2/C#           E
And I receive the prize that Christ has won
                       C#m     B      A
I will be with You in Paradise
                      C#m     B      E A2 E/G# A2
I will be with You in Paradise

**CHORUS** x2
