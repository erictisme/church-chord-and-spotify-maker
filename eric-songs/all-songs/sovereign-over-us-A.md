# Sovereign Over Us

[Intro]
F#m, D, E, A

[Verse 1]
F#m                            D
There is strength within the sorrow
E                        A
There is Beauty in our tears
F#m                        D
And you meet us in our mourning
E                          A
With a love that cast out fears.
F#m                        D
You are working in our waiting
E           A
Sanctifying us
F#m                       D
And beyond our understanding
E                      A
Your teaching us to trust

[Chorus]
D, A, E, F#m
D                          A
Your plans are still to prosper
E                     F#m
You have not forgotten us
D                      A              E
You're with us in the fire and the flood
       D             A
You're Faithful forever
E            F#m
Perfect in love
        D          E   A
You are Sovereign Over us

[Verse 2]
F#m                D
You are wisdom unimagined,
E                         A
Who could understand your ways
F#m                       D
Reigning high above the heavens,
E                         A
Reaching down in endless grace
F#m                       D
You're the Lifter of the lowly,
E                 A
Compassionate and kind
F#m                         D
You surround and You uphold me,
E                     A
And your promises are my delight

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
A                             D
Even what the enemy means for evil
                    Bm
You turn it for our good
                    E
You Turn it for our good and for your glory
A                           D
Even in the valley you are faithful
                       Bm
You're working for our good
                        E
You're working for our good and for your glory

**CHORUS**
