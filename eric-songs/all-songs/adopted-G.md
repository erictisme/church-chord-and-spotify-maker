# Adopted

[Intro]
G

[Verse 1]
G
Don't you think it's odd
G
We can talk to God
      C
And call him 'Father'
G
'Our Father'?
G
He chose us to be
G
In his family
     C
Now we're his children
         D
His children

[Chorus]
G
We've been adopted
     G
We've been adopted
C
Children of the king
    D
So we've got a song to sing
     G
We've been adopted
     G
We've been adopted
C
Jesus is our brother
       D
So we can love each other
G
Been adopted
     G
We've been adopted
C        D    G
We're in the family of God

**INTRO**

[Verse 2]
G
By the Spirit's power
G
Everything is ours
             C
Through Christ our brother
G
Our brother
G
Here's how we belong
G
Faith in Christ the Son
         C
Now we're God's children
D
His children

**CHORUS**
**INTRO**

[Verse 3]
G
See the lavish love
G
Given from above
      C
From God the Father
G
Our Father
G
Everywhere, we'll be
G
In God's family
           C
Now and forever
D
Forever

[Chorus 2]
G
We've been adopted
     G
We've been adopted
C
Children of the king
    D
So we've got a song to sing
     G
We've been adopted
     G
We've been adopted
C
Jesus is our brother
       D
So we can love each other
G
We're sharing all his treasure
G
Much more than you can measure
C
God the Father does us choose
D
An offer that we can't refuse
G
Jesus is amazing
G
He's our brother who's been saving
C
We're siblings now with Jesus
D
So we know we're loved to pieces
C        D    G
We're in the family of God
