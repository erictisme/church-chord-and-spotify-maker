# Psalm 92 It Is Good

[Chorus]
       G               C         G
It is good to give thanks to the Lord
       C            Em      D
It is good to give thanks to the Lord
   G                 C      G
To sing praises to Your name, O most high
   C            Em      D
To sing praises to Your name, O most high

[Verse 1]
C               G           D
To declare your steadfast love in the morning
C              G            D
And your faithfulness O my God by night
         Em               D
To the music of the ten stringed lyre
        C          G
And the melody of the harp

**CHORUS**

[Verse 2]
C             G                 D
You, O Lord have made me glad by your work
C                 G              D
At the work of your hand I sing for joy
        Em           D
How great are your works O Lord
         C           G
You thoughts are very deep

**CHORUS** x2
