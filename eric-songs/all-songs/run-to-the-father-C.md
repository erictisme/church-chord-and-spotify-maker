C  Dm7add4  Am7  F2
```

## Verse 1
```
C                Dm7add4
I've carried a burden
Am7                F2
for too long on my own
C            Dm7add4
I wasn't created
Am7           F2
to bear it alone

C               Dm7add4
I hear Your invitation
Am7             F2
to let it all go
           C                  Dm7add4
I see it now, I'm laying it down
                Am7 G   F2
And I know that I need You
```

## Chorus 1
```
              C                    Dm7add4
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
                    Am7                 F2
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
                   C                        Dm7add4
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
                     Am7              F2
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
```

C Dm7add4 Am7    F2
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
```

## Verse 2
```
C              Dm7add4
You saw my condition,
Am7                   F2
had a plan from the start
C                 Dm7add4
Your Son for redemption,
Am7                F2
the price for my heart

C                   Dm7add4
And I don't have a context
Am7                F2
for that kind of love
               C                  Dm7add4
I don't understand, I can't comprehend
              Am7 G   F2
All I know is I need You
```

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
                   C                        Dm7add4
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
                     Am7              F2
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

## Bridge
```
                    Am7     F2
My heart has been in Your sights
             C/E       G
Long before my first breath
            Am7    F2
Running into Your arms
                C/E      G
Is running to life from death

                  Am7            F2
And I feel this rush deep in my chest
                 C/E   G
Your mercy is calling out
           Am7            F2
Just as I am You pull me in
               C/E     G
And I know I need You now
```

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
                   C                        Dm7add4
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father again and again

My heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
