# Speak O Lord

D          E  A                   D             A/C#
Speak, O Lord, as we come to You

To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
D          E     A                   D           A/C#
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;

Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
E     E/D   A/C#                 D      A/C#
That the light of     Christ might be seen today
E    E/D  A/C#              D           E
In our acts of     love and our deeds of faith.
D          E     A                   D    A/C#
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us

All Your purposes for Your glo ry.

D          E  A                   D             A/C#
Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
D           A/C#              F#m  E
Holy reverence, true humility;
D          E     A                   D           A/C#
Test our thoughts and our attitudes

In the radiance of Your purity.
E     E/D   A/C#                 D      A/C#
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
E    E/D  A/C#              D           E
Your majestic love and authority.
D          E     A                   D    A/C#
Words of pow'r that can never fail—
D    A/C#                E   A
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;

Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us—
D          E     A                   D           A/C#
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
D          A/C#         E   A
That will echo down through eternity.

E     E/D   A/C#                 D      A/C#
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
E    E/D  A/C#              D           E
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
D          E     A                   D    A/C#
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
D    A/C#                E   A
And the earth is filled with Your glory.
