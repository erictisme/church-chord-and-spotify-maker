# What A Friend We Have In Jesus

[Verse 1]
C               F       C
What a friend we have in Jesus
        G               C
All our sins and griefs to bear
                F       C
What a privilege to carry
        G               C
Everything to God in prayer

        F               C
Oh what peace we often forfeit
        G               C
Oh what needless pain we bear
                F       Am
All because we do not carry
    C       G       C
Everything to God in prayer

[Verse 2]
C               F       C
Have we trials and temptations
        G               C
Is there trouble anywhere
                F       C
We should never be discouraged
        G               C
Take it to the Lord in prayer

        F               C
Can we find a friend so faithful
        G               C
Who will all our sorrows share
                F       Am
Jesus knows our every weakness
    C       G       C
Take it to the Lord in prayer

[Verse 3]
C               F       C
Are we weak and heavy laden
        G               C
Cumbered with a load of care
                F       C
Precious Saviour still our refuge
        G               C
Take it to the Lord in prayer

        F               C
Do thy friends despise forsake thee
        G               C
Take it to the Lord in prayer
                F       Am
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
    C       G       C
Thou wilt find a solace there
