# A Pure Heart

[Intro]
D

[Verse]
D                         F#m                      G
A pure heart, that's what I long for.
Em                                A                 D  Em A
A heart that follows hard after Thee;
D                   F#m                          G
A pure heart, that's what I long for.
G                                 A                D
A heart that follows hard after Thee.

[Chorus]
G                                      A
A heart that hides Your Word
D                           Bm D7
So that sin will not come in.
G                         A
A heart that's undivided
D             Em          F#/D7      D
But one You rule and reign;
G                               A
A heart that beats compassion,
F#m                       Bm7
That pleases You, my Lord.
G                        A
A sweet aroma of worship
G      A            D
That rises to Your throne.
