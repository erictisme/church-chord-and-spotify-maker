# Anchor

[Verse 1]
G
In every season, in every change
                                    Em
You are near
                                    C
In every sorrow, You are my strength
                                    G
You are near

[Pre-Chorus]
                                    D
A peace in the storm
                                    Em
Your voice I will follow
                                    C
In weakness I rise
                                    G
Remembering You hold

[Chorus]
        D                   Em
My world in Your hands
                            C
And You won't let go
                            G
You won't let go
        D                   Em
No You won't let go
                            C
You won't let go

[Verse 2]
G
Unchanging, the Author of my days
                                    Em
I'm secure
                                    C
You're the anchor, my hope and stay
                                    G
You are sure

**PRE-CHORUS**

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
D                               Em
I will hold onto You
                                C
I will hold onto You
                                G
Through it all, I will hold onto You
D                               Em
Jesus You hold me fast
                                C
You won't let go
