I come, God, I come

I return to the Lord
             G
The one who's broken
              D            A
The one who's torn me apart

          Bm              A
You strike down to bind me up
           Em            Bm
You say you do it all in love

That I might know you in your suffering

Though you take from me
Bm               A
I will bless your name
           G    D
Though you ruin me
Bm             A
Still I will worship

Sing a song to the one who's all I need

    Bm                  A
My heart and flesh may fail
    Em                Bm
The earth below give way
             G              D
But with my eyes, with my eyes
                  A
I'll see the Lord

       Bm           A
Lifted high on that day
            Em            Bm
Behold, the Lamb that was slain
          G          D
And I'll know every tear was worth
        A
it all

Em                  Bm

A                 Bm
Let this cup pass from me now
G                      A   Bm
You're still more than I need

You're enough for me

You're enough for me
