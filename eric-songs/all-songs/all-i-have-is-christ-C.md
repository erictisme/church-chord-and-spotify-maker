# All I Have Is Christ

[Intro]
||: Am  C/E | F  C/E | F  G | C    :||  | C x2

[Verse 1]
G                     Am
I once was lost in darkest night
F            Am
Yet thought I knew the way
Dm                      F
The sin that promised joy and life
G        C
Had led me to the grave
C/E                             F
I had no hope that You would own
Dm         Am
A rebel to Your will
C/E              F
And if You had not loved me first
Am        G
I would refuse You still

[Instrumental]
||: Am  C/E | F  C/E | F  G | C    :||  | C

[Verse 2]
G                            Am
But as I ran my hell-bound race
F           Am
Indifferent to the cost
Dm                     F
You looked upon my helpless state
G           C
And led me to the cross
C/E                     F
And I beheld God's love displayed
Dm        Am
You suffered in my place
C/E                         F
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Am           G
Now all I know is grace

[Chorus] (Soft, build on 2nd)
F C             G          Am
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
F  Am        G      C
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life x2

**INTRO**
||: Am  C/E | F  C/E | F  G | C    :||  | C x2

[Verse 3] (Soft)
G                     Am
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
F             C
And live so all might see
Dm                        F
The strength to follow Your commands
G            C
Could never come from me
C
Oh Father, use my ransomed life

In any way You choose
Am               F
And let my song forever be
Am           G
My only boast is You

[Chorus] Loud
F C             G          Am
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
F  Am        G      C
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life x2

[Outtro]
||: Am  C/E | F  C/E | F  G | C    :||  | C x2
