# Amazing Grace

[Refrain]
D        D7              G               D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
A
That saved a wretch like me!
D           D7          G            D
I once was lost, but now am found,
Bm           A       D
Was blind, but now I see.

[Verse 1]
D              D7            G           D
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
A
And grace my fears relieved.
D           D7         G           D
How precious did that grace appear,
Bm      A         D
The hour I first believed.

[Verse 2]
D       D7         G             D
Through many dangers, toils and snares
A
We have already come
D              D7              G             D
'Twas grace hath brought us safe thus far
Bm          A           D
And grace will lead us home

[Verse 3]
D             D7           G          D
The Lord has promised good to me,
A
His word my hope secures;
D          D7              G       D
He will my shield and portion be
Bm        A         D
as long as life endures.

[Verse 4]
D                D7             G           D
When we've been there ten thousand years,
A
Bright shining as the sun,
D         D7         G               D
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Bm            A         D
Than when we'd first begun.
