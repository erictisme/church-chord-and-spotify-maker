# The Old Rugged Cross

[Verse 1]
G                      C              G
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
                             A7         D
The emblem of suffering and shame;
    G                         C              G
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
              D               G
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[Chorus]
                D               G
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
                            A7         D
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
    G                         C           G
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
             D                  G
And exchange it some day for a crown.

[Verse 2]
G                      C              G
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
                        A7         D
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
    G                      C              G
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
              D             G
To bear it to dark Calvary.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
G                      C              G
In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
                             A7         D
A wondrous beauty I see,
    G                      C              G
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
              D              G
To pardon and sanctify me.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
G                      C              G
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
                             A7         D
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
    G                      C              G
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
              D              G
Where His glory forever I'll share.

**CHORUS**
