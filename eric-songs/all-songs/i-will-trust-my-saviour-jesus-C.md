# I Will Trust My Saviour Jesus

[Intro]
| C / / | Am / / | F / / | C / / |
| C / / | Am / / | F / / | C / / |

[Verse 1]
       C                          Am
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
                  F                           C
When my darkest doubts befall
                  Am                               F
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
                   C            G        C
Seems the hardest thing of all

[Instrumental]
| C / / | Am / / | F / / | C / / |

[Verse 2]
       C                Am
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
           F                   C
Trust Him when my strength is small
       Am                 F
For I know the shield of Jesus
        C      G        C
Is the safest place of all

[Chorus]
F                   C
Jesus, only Jesus
               Am                            G
Help me trust You more and more
F                    C
Jesus, only Jesus
              Am           G    F
May my heart be ever Yours

[Verse 3]
       C                Am
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
        F               C
He has said His way is best
       Am                 F
And I know the path He's chosen
         C    G      C
Leads to everlasting rest

[Bridge]
C               G
Oh on that cross
Dm             Am
How it was seen
          F                    C
I can go now ever trusting
           G                        C
In the One who died for me
C                   G
What could I bring
             Dm           Am
For Your gift is complete
        F                                C
So I trust You simply trust You
                 G                 C
Lord with every part of me

**BRIDGE** x3 (Build-up)
