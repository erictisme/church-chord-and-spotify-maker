C

## Verse 1
```
C                                         F2
When all I see is the battle, you see my victory
Am7                                 Gsus        F2
When all I see is the mountain, you see a mountain moved
C                                               F2
And as I walk through the shadows, your love surrounds me
Am7                                Gsus    C
There's nothing to fear now, for I am safe  with you
```

## Chorus
```
    F2          C           G              Am7          F2
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees, with my hands lifted high
    C                 G        Am7
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
       F2     C           G          Am7              F
Every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night
    C               G         C
Oh God, the battle belongs to you
```

## Verse 2
```
C                                   F2
And if you are for me, who can be against me
Am7                         Gsus    F2
For Jesus there's nothing impossible for you
C                                           F2
When all I see are the ashes, you see the beauty
Am7                                 Gsus       C
When all I see is a cross, God you see the empty tomb
```

## Chorus

## Bridge (x3)
```
F          C                Gsus
Almighty fortress, you go before us
             Am7              Gsus          F
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
F                  C                    Gsus
You shine in the shadows you win every battle
             Am7               Gsus         F
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
```
