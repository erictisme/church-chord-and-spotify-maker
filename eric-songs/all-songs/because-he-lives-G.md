# Because He Lives

[Verse 1]
                               G     G7                                    C
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,
                           G      Em7                        Am7   D7
He came to love, heal and forgive;
                               G    G7                         C            Cm
He lived and died  to buy my pardon,
                        G               Em7           Am7              D7              G    C  G
An empty tomb is there to prove my Saviour lives,

[Chorus]
        D7                G      G7                            C           Am7
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
        D7                Bm7 Em7                    Am7    D7
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
                         G      G7                              C         Cm
Because I know, He holds the future,
                           G                     Em7     Am7          D7               G
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

[Verse 2]
                            G     G7                           C
The Son of God, He paid my ransom;
                             G      Em7                      Am7   D7
Went to the cross, My sins to bear,
                           G    G7                         C             Cm
No greater love! His life He laid down,
                            G              Em7         Am7     D7         G    C  G
He died for me and thus forever set me free.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
                              G     G7                         C
Now I serve Him, My Living Saviour;
                            G    Em7                        Am7   D7
I walk with Him, from day to day,
                              G    G7                           C           Cm
He leads me on  the heavenly pathway;
                           G                 Em7         Am7          D7         G    C  G
I know He keeps me in the shadow of His wings.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
                                 G    G7                            C
And then one day, I'll cross the river,
                                  G     Em7                  Am7   D7
I'll fight life's final  war with pain;
                               G      G7                           C            Cm
And then as death gives way to victory,
                           G              Em7     Am7          D7               G    C  G
I'll see the light of glory and I'll know He lives.

**CHORUS**
