# Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
**Key: E**

## Chorus (Slow)
```
E        B         C#m E
Turn you eyes upon Je-sus,
     A           F#m        B7
Look full in His wonderful face;
        E         E7              A         Am
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
       E            B         E
In the light of His glory and grace.
```

## Verse 1 (Fast)
```
E            B         C#m  E
O soul are you weary and troubled?
   A            F#m           E    B
No light in the darkness you see?
        E           E7          A  Am
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
    E         B            E
And life more abundant and free
```

## Chorus

## Verse 2
```
E                  B         C#m E
Through death into life everlas-ting
   A              F#m         E     B
He passed, and we follow Him there
     E      E7           A    Am
Over us sin no more hath dominion
    E         B             E
For more than conqu'rors we are
```

## Chorus

## Verse 3
```
E                  B           C#m E
His word shall not fail you He promised
  A             F#m          E     B
Believe Him and all will be well.
     E       E7            A Am
Then go to a world that is dying,
    E       B            E
His perfect salvation to tell
```
