# O Praise the Name

[Verse 1]
                  G
I cast my mind to Calvary
            D                 Em
Where Jesus bled and died for me
           C          D          G
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
                   D                G
My Saviour on that cursed tree

G D

[Verse 2]
           G
His body bound and drenched in tears
               D               Em
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
             C                G
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
         D                 G
Messiah still and all alone

G D

[Chorus]
       G                 C        G
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
     Em             D
O praise His Name forever - more
       G                  C          G
For endless days, we will sing Your praise
     C      D         G
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

[Verse 3]
             G
Then on the third, at break of dawn
             D           Em
The Son of heaven rose again
            C                    G
O trampled death, where is your sting
            D                   G
The angels roar for Christ the King

G D

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
                  G
He shall return in robes of white
             D                     Em
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
            C              G
And I will rise among the saints
               D           G
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

G D

**CHORUS**

        F           Gsus4 G   Am
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
        F           Gsus4 G   C
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
