# God of Miracles

[Verse 1]
            G
Let faith arise
                                     C
in spite of what I see, Lord I believe,
                                      Em
But help my unbelief, I choose to trust You
                                      C
No matter what I feel, let faith arise

[Verse 2]
            G
Let faith arise
                                   C
For my champion's not dead, He is alive!
                                     Em
Oh, and He already knows my every need
                                    C
Surely He will come and rescue me

[Chorus]
Em     C              G
God of miracles come
   D                    Em    C
We need Your supernatural
 G                  D
love to break through
Em           C             G
Nothing's impossible
              D           Em  C  G  D
You're the God of miracles

[Instrumental]
 C Em C D

[Verse 3]
           G
Let faith arise,
                                    C
and see the kingdom come, I lift my eyes, oh
                                        Em
for the battle has been won, My God is faithful, oh
                                  C
and every single word He said is true, oh

 This world is shaking
Em          D

 but I'm not broken yet
C              G
 Your love is fearless
Em               D          C
 Help me to be courageous too

 Oh there is nothing impossible
