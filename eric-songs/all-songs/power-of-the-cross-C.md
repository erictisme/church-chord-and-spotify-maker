# Power of the Cross

[Intro]
Am G/B C Em F x2

[Verse 1]
Am      G/B       C
Oh, to see the dawn
C        Dm       C/E
Of the darkest day
F                  C/E        Dm C G/B
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Am         G/B    C
Tried by sinful men,
C             Dm       C/E
Torn and beaten, then
F                 C/E        G
Nailed to a cross of wood.

[Chorus]
(Em)         F       G     C
This, the pow'r of the cross:
(Em)         F      G       C
Christ became sin for us;
(Em)         F           F#dim       G
Took the blame, bore the wrath—
G/B   Am                G          Am  G/B  C Em  F
We stand forgiven at the cross.

[Verse 2]
Am     G/B    C
Oh, to see the pain
C        Dm          C/E
Written on Your face,
F                   C/E           Dm   C G/B
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Am   G/B    C
Ev'ry bitter thought,
C     Dm   C/E
Ev'ry evil deed
F                         C/E                G
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3] (Soft)
Am         G/B     C
Now the daylight flees;
C             Dm          C/E
Now the ground beneath
F                     C/E     Dm     C  G/B
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Am       G/B     C
Curtain torn in two,
C               Dm       C/E
Dead are raised to life;
 F                     C/E     G  G/A  G/B
"Finished!" the vict'ry cry.

**CHORUS**

Am  G/B  C Em  F x2

[Verse 4]
Am      G/B    C
Oh, to see my name
C        Dm      C/E
Written in the wounds,
F                           C/E      Dm C   G/B
For through Your suffering I am free.
Am           G/B           C
Death is crushed to death;
C         Dm       C/E
Life is mine to live,
F                            C/E        G
Won through Your selfless love.

[Final Chorus]
(Em)        F       G       C
This, the pow'r of the cross:
(Em)      F      G       C
Son of God—slain for us.
(Em)      F       F#dim       G
What a love! What a cost!
G/B  Am                G         Am  G/B  C Em  F
We stand forgiven at the cross.
