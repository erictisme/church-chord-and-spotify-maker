```
         Am       F
From the chaos of darkness
     C               G
Your word shaped the earth
        Am      F      C
In your image a people made

       Am        F
But we traded perfection
    C           G
The truth for a lie
         Am        F         C
And your glory was veiled in shame
```

      F       C
But a promise made

A blessing you gave
     F      C       G
To a people of your name
         F      C
For this broken world

A saviour foretold

To bear all our grief and pain
   Am C C

## Verse 3
```
         Am       F
When the heavenly saviour
   C          G
Descended his throne
       Am         F         C
All my sin on his shoulders laid

       Am        F
And to win our redemption
   C            G
He suffered and died
        Am         F         C
For the sake of my guilt and shame
```

## Verse 4
```
       F        C
Oh the price he paid
   G         Am
In taking my place
        F         C   G
so that death was overcome
        F       C
For the king of love
      Em             Am
Burst forth from the grave
   F            G       F
Proclaiming the victory won
   Am C C
```

```
       Am         F
At the end of the ages
    C            G
The world passed away
       Am         F         C
I will gaze on my saviour's face

        Am          F
When my heart is perfected
     C       G
Free from my sin
       Am           F        C
I will rest in your glorious grace

        F       C
For the song we raise

The works of our hands
       F       C      G
Are in service of the king
       F        C
When a thousand tounges
     Em       Am
Cry "Glory to God"
   F        G            F
Forever his praise we'll sing

        F       C
For the song we raise
    G            Am
The works of our hands
       F       C      G
Are in service of the king
       F        C
When a thousand tounges
     Em       Am
Cry "Glory to God"

Forever his praise we'll sing
