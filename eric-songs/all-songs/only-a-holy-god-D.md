[Verse 1]
Bm                    D                  G            D
Who else commands all the hosts of heaven
Bm                      D              G              D
Who else could make every king bow down
Bm                   D                 G                    D
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles

Only a Holy God

[Verse 2]
Bm              D                 G             D
What other beauty demands such praises
Bm              D                    G              D
What other splendour outshines the sun
Bm                D        G             D
What other majesty rules with justice
G         A      D
Only a Holy God

Bm               G
Come and behold Him
         D                 A
The One and the Only
Bm                G
Cry out, sing holy
      D        A      Bm
Forever a Holy God
                 G                 A      D (Bm on 2nd)
Come and worship the Holy God

Bm              D           G                D
What other glory consumes like fire
Bm             D               G             D
What other power can raise the dead
Bm               D                    G       D
What other name remains undefeated
G          A     D

Who else could rescue me from my failing
Bm                     D            G     D
Who else would offer His only Son
Bm             D                G              D
Who else invites me to call Him Father
G         A    D
Only a Holy God

Only my Holy God
