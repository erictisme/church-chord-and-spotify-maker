# How Great Thou Art

F#m D A/C# E

[Verse 1]
A             D/A
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,
A      E                                          A
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
A                                       D/A
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
A          E
Thy power throughout the universe
A
displayed

[Chorus 1]

How great Thou Art, How great Thou Art

[Verse 2]
A                           D/A
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
A       E                   	      A
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
A                          D/A
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
A          E                     A
He bled and died to take away my sin

[Chorus 2]
A            D                       A
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
E                               A                   Bm A/C#
How great Thou Art, How great Thou Art
A             D                     A
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
E
How great Thou Art, how great Thou Art

F#m D A/C# E

[Verse 3]
A                            D/A
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
A                  E                         A
And lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart
A                            D/A
Then I shall bow with humble adoration
A        E                                 A
And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
E                               A                  Bm A/C#
How great Thou Art, How great Thou Art
A            D                     A
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
E                              F#m
How great Thou Art, how great Thou Art
E                              A
How great Thou Art, how great Thou Art
