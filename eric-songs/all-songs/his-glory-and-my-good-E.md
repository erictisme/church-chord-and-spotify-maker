# His Glory and My Good

[Intro]
Asus2 E   B C#m7 x2

[Verse 1]
Asus2                      E
I have seen my Father's glory
B                    C#m7
Revealed in Jesus Christ
Asus2                     E
And the more that I behold Him
B             C#m7
The more He satisfies
A                    E
When I gaze upon His beauty
B                C#m7
When I see Him as I should
Asus2               E/G#
Then my eyes are lifted upward
B                         Asus2 E   B C#m7
For His glory and my good

[Verse 2]
Asus2             E
There is hope in every trial
B                    C#m7
For I can trust the Lord
Asus2               E
He will turn my heart towards Him
B                       C#m7
And help me bear the thorn
A                    E
So in faith I follow Jesus
B                      C#m7
On the road not understood
Asus2                 E/G#
For I know that He is working
B                           E5 A4
For His glory and my good

[Chorus 1]
E
To our God be the glory
A       E
To our God be praise
C#m7                     B
He alone, the name above all names
E/G#                   A      C#m7
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
A       B                  Asus2 E   B C#m7
For I know His glory is my good

[Verse 3]
Asus2               E
See the open arms of Jesus
B                       C#m7
Upon the cross that day
Asus2                 E
What they understood as weakness
B                    C#m7
Deserves my every praise
A                            E
For the charge that was against me
B                   C#m7
It was nailed into the wood
Asus2                      E/G#
Yes I know that He has saved me
B                   E
For His glory and my good

**CHORUS**

[Instrumental]
A E/G#   C#m7 B x4

[Verse 4]
Asus2                     E
Would I gladly be made nothing
B                               C#m7
That Christ would be made more
Asus2                      E
Would I seek the only kingdom
B                      C#m7
That far outweighs them all
A                          E
I will stand before my Father
B                             C#m7
Where the faithful saints have stood
Asus2                     E/G#
And with joy my heart shall praise Him
B                       E
For His glory and my good

**CHORUS**

A       B          C#m7
For I know His glory is my good
A       B
For I know His glory is my good

[Ending]
Asus2 E   B E
