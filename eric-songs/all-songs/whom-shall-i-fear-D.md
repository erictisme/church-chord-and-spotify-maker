# Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)

[Verse 1]
D                          A
You hear me when I call
                  Bm
You are my morning song
                           G
Though darkness fills the night
                      D
It cannot hide the light
A     Bm   G
Whom shall I fear?

[Verse 2]
D                        A
You crush the enemy
                       Bm
Underneath my feet
                       G
You are my Sword and Shield
                      D
Though trouble lingers still
A     Bm   G
Whom shall I fear?

[Chorus]
D                        A
I know Who goes before me
                   Bm
I know Who stands behind
             G
The God of angel armies
           D    A  Bm  G
Is always by my side
D                            A
The One who reigns forever
                  Bm
He is a friend of mine
             G
The God of angel armies
           D    A  Bm  G
Is always by my side

[Verse 3]
D                       A
My strength is in Your name
                     Bm
For You alone can save
                     G
Will You deliver me
                  D
Yours is the victory
A     Bm   G
Whom shall I fear?
A     Bm   G
Whom shall I fear?

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
G                     D
And nothing formed against me shall stand
                      A
You hold the whole world in Your hands
                             Bm
I'm holding on to Your promises
                 G
You are faithful, You are faithful
                  D
You are faithful

**BRIDGE** (repeat)

**CHORUS** x2
