INTRO: G || C | G ||  C | G || C | G

[Verse 1]
                  G     C           G
Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
C         G/D      D            G
Let me hide myself in Thee;
              D                  C/E
Let the water and the blood,
                 D                             C/E
from Thy wounded side which flowed,
D/F#  G         C         G
Be of sin the double cure,
C               G/D           D            G
Save from wrath and make me pure.

G || C | G ||  C | G || C | G

              G        C         G
Not the labour of my hands
C         G/D        D          G
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
                 D                     C/E
Could my zeal no respite know,
                 D                  C/E
Could my tears forever flow,
D/F#    G           C    G
All for sin could not atone;
C                G/D       D         G
Thou must save and Thou alone.

G || C | G ||  C | G || C | G

               G         C           G
Nothing in my hand I bring,
C        G/D         D        G
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
              D                        C/E
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
                 D                      C/E
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
D/F#    G       C         G
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
C                G/D      D   Em
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
C                G/D       D     G
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

                  G          C           G
While I draw this fleeting breath,
C                  G/D          D           Em
When mine eyes shall close in death,
              D                  C/E
When I rise to worlds unknown,
                D                         C/E
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
D/F#       G      C           G
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
            G/E                           C#m
Let me hide myself, Let me hide myself
             C         D          Em
Let me hide myself in Thee.
Em/D | Em/C                       C#m/A
Let me hide myself, Let me hide
            G/D       D          G
Let me hide myself in Thee.
