# Heart of Worship
**Key: E**
**Artist: Matt Redman**

## Verse
```
E                            B                                 F#m7
When the music fades all is stripped away
                     B
and I simply come

E                          B
Longing just to bring  something that's of
F#m                                       B
worth that will bless your heart
```

## Pre-Chorus
```
F#m             E/G#              B
I'll bring you more than a song
                        F#m                      E/G#
for a song in itself is not what you have
       B
required
F#m                       E/G#            B
you search much deeper within through
                                    F#m                       E/G#
the way things appear you're looking into
        B
my heart
```

## Chorus
```
E                                        B
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
              F#m
and it's all about you
       A               B      E
it's all about you Jesus
E                                     B
I'm sorry lord for the thing I made it
                 F#m                        A
when it's all about you it's all
              B    E
about you Jesus
```

## Verse 2
```
E                           B
King of endless worth no one could
F#m                                   B
express how much you deserve

E                                   B
though i'm weak and poor all i have is
F#m              B
yours every single breath
```
