[Intro]
A    E | F#m D
A  E | F#m D

[Verse 1]
A             D/A  A
Before the throne of God above
A                           C#m
I have a strong and perfect plea
D                               F#m
A great High Priest whose name is Love
D                              A
Who ever lives and pleads for me
D                    E
My name is graven on His hands
D                    F#m
My name is written on His heart
D                           F#m
I know that while in Heaven He stands
D                     E  F#m
No tongue can bid me thence de-part
D                   E  A
No tongue can bid me thence de-part

**INTRO**

[Verse 2]
A                  D/A   A
When Satan tempts me to despair
A                C#m
And tells me of the guilt within
D                         F#m
Upward I look and see Him there
D                  A
Who made an end to all my sin
D                     E
Because the sinless Savior died
D                     F#m
My sinful soul is counted free
D              F#m
For God the Just is satisfied
D                  E   F#m
To look on Him and pardon me
D               E
To look on Him and pardon me

G   |    |F#m  |    |G   |D    |E

[Verse 3]
A               D/A   A
Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!
A                       C#m
My perfect, spotless righteousness
D               F#m
The great unchangeable I AM
D                   A
The King of Glory and of Grace
D                  E
One with Himself, I cannot die
D                         F#m
My soul is purchased by His blood
D                          F#m
My life is hid with Christ on high
D                  E  F#m
With Christ, my Savior and my God
D         E
With Christ, my Savior and my God
