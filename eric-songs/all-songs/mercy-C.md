# Mercy

[Verse 1]
           C            G/B
I will kneel in the dust
           Dm7           C/E
At the foot of the cross
        Am       Gsus4 G   Csus4  C
Where mercy paid for me
                     C        G/B
Where the wrath I deserve
       Dm7          C/E
It is gone, it has passed
         Am         Gsus4 G  Csus4 C
Your blood has hidden me

[Chorus]
 Am      F2
Mercy, mercy,
       G                   C
As endless as the sea
       Am                F2
I'll sing Your hallelujah
        G       C
For all eternity

[Verse 2]
         C           G/B
We will lift up the cup
         Dm7           C/E
And the bread we will break
       Am   Gsus4 G  Csus4 C
Remembering Your love
                   C          G/B
We were fallen from grace
              Dm7            C/E
But You took on our shame
    Am     Gsus4 G Csus4 C
And nailed it to a cross.

**CHORUS** x2

[Bridge]
           C                   Am
May I never lose the wonder,
              F                        G
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy.
           Am                 F2
May I sing Your hallelujah.
           Dm  G C
Hallelujah, Amen.  (x4)

[Verse 1]
        C           G/B
I will kneel in the dust
        Dm7         C/E
At the foot of the cross
        Am       Gsus4 G   Csus4  C
Where mercy paid for me
