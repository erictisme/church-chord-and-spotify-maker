# The Love of God

[Intro]
A D/A F#m Esus4

[Verse 1]
A
The love of God is greater far
                            E                      A
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
             A
It goes beyond the highest star,
                        E                      A
And reaches to the lowest hell;
                  D                                        A
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
                        E           A
God gave His Son to win;
                   D                       A
His erring child He reconciled,
                           E              A
And pardoned from his sin.

D F#m E

[Verse 2]
                        A                          F#m
When year of time shall pass away,
                      Esus                                 A
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
                              A
When men who here refuse to pray,
                         E                                  A
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
                          D                            A
God's love so sure, shall still endure,
                    E              A
All measureless and strong;
                     D                            A
Redeeming grace to Adam's race—
                            E            A
The saints' and angels' song.

[Chorus]
                      D                             A
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
          E                            A
How measureless and strong!
                 D                     A
It shall forevermore endure—
                             E           A
The saints' and angels' song.

D F#m G D

[Verse 3 Soft]
                           A
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
                        Esus4                            A
And were the skies of parchment made,
                      A
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
                    E                            A
And every man a scribe by trade;
                       D                     A
To write the love of God above
                               E          A
Would drain the ocean dry;
                           D                             A
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
                                           E         A
Though stretched from sky to sky.
