# His Mercy is More

[Chorus]
A E C#m   B    	A E B
Praise the Lord,	his mercy is more
A             	E  	B (Cmdim)   C#m
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
A            	E    	B    	E
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more

[Verse 1]
E                        	A       	    E
What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
B          	C#m       	A           	B
Omniscient, all-knowing, he counts not their sum
E        	F#m      	E/G#   	A
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
A              	E    	B    	E
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more

**CHORUS**

[Verse 2]
E                           	A      	E
What patience would wait as we constantly roam
B          	C#m   	A     	B
What father so tender is calling us home
E        	F#m      	E/G#   	A
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
A              	E    	B    	E
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3] Soft
E                      	A      	E
What riches of kindness he lavished on us
B          	C#m       	A        	B
His blood was the payment his life was the cost
E        	F#m      	E/G#   	A
We stood neath a debt we could never afford
A             	E    	B     	E                            	E
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more (so much more)

**CHORUS** x2, 2nd die down, come in on Stronger

Last Line:
A            	E    	B    	C#m
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more
A            	E    	B    	C#m
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more
A            	E    	B    	E
Our sins they are many, his mercy is more
