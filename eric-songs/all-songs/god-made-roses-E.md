# God Made Roses

[Intro]
E   A   C#m   B  x2

[Verse 1]
E                    A                   C#m    B
Ever wonder what was on the mind of the maker
E                          A                        C#m  B
When He turned all of our sorrow into fields of grace
E                   A                     C#m  B
Right here in the middle of earth and heaven
E                     A           Bsus   B
Caught between the romance and the pain
Can't you see that

[Chorus]
E                             A          C#m      B
He must've known about the heartbreak long before us
E                             A
He must've known about the mistakes,
C#m      B
still He chose us
             E
Planted the tree where He would die
      A                      	   	  C#m        B
Put thorns down the vine, and then He wore them
              	    E                     A
And love is the blood red stain, the beauty
		B
 that the pain exposes
                            			E
Maybe that's why God made roses

E    A   C#m B x2

[Verse 2]
E              A                       C#m    B
God is in the whisper if you listen closely
E                   A                     C#m     B
Winter means that spring is just a breath away
E                  A                       C#m   B
So don't go any faster than this very moment
E            A                    Bsus   B
Sing a hallelujah the pouring rain
Can't you see that

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
E                       A              C#m
And just like petals falling to the ground
   B               E            A                   C#m7
We fall in to the one who's resurrection's here and now
      B
All things made new
E                       A              C#m
And just like petals falling to the ground
   B               E            A                   C#m7
We fall in to the one who's resurrection's here and now
      B          E   A   B
All things made new
Can't you see that

[Chorus]
E                               A      C#m       B
He must've known about the heartbreak long before us
E                             A        C#m        B
He must've known about the mistakes, still He chose us
             E
Planted the tree where He would die
      A                         C#m       B
Put thorns down the vine, and then He wore them
                  E                     A                    B
And love is the blood red stain, the beauty that the pain exposes
                                E     A    C#m     B
Maybe that's why God made roses
