# Your Will Be Done

[Intro]
C   Am   F   C (x2)

[Verse 1]
C                                    F
Your will be done, my God and Father
C            Am     G
As in heaven,   so on earth
C                         F
My heart is drawn to self-exalting
C               G             C
Help me seek Your Kingdom first

[Chorus 1]
C                       F
As Jesus walked, so I shall walk
C                Am        G
Held by Your same un - changing love
C                           F                 C
Be still my soul, O lift your voice and pray:
F           C             G             C
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done.'

C      Am     F      C

[Verse 2]
C                       F
How in that Garden He persisted
C      Am    G
I may never fully know
C                       F
The fearful weight of true obedience
C          G      C
It was held by Him alone

[Chorus 2]
C                          F
What wondrous faith, to bear that cross
C                Am         G
To bear my sin, what wondrous love
Am          C/E       F            C/E
My hope was sure, when there my Saviour prayed:
F          C         G           C
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done.'

C      Am     F      C

[Verse 3]
C                          F
When I am lost, when I am broken
C         Am         G
In the night of fear and doubt
C                         F
Still I will trust in my good Father
C/E           G      C
Yes, to one great King I bow!

[Chorus 3]
C                         F
As Jesus rose, so I shall rise
C        Am      G
In ransomed glory at the throne
C              C/E         F         C
My heart restored, with all Your saints I sing:
F         C          G             C
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done!'

C      Am     F      C

[Verse 4]
C                              F
As we go forth, our God and Father
C      Am     G
Lead us daily   in the fight
C/E                           F
That all the world might see Your glory
C/E          G        C
And Your Name be lifted high!

[Chorus 4]
C                        F
[And in this Name we overcome
C          Am      G
For You shall see us safely home
Am        C/E    F             C
Now as Your church, we lift our voice and pray:
F      C         G             C
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done!'] x2

[Tag]
C/E       F          C          G           Am
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done'
C/E       F          C          G           C
'Father, not my will, but Yours be done'

[Outro]
C  Am
