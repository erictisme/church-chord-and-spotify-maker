# Holy, Holy, Holy

[Verse 1]
C
Holy, Holy, Holy,
F
Lord God Almighty!
Em                       Am
Early in the morning,
D7                                  G7
Our song shall rise to Thee;
C
Holy, Holy, Holy!
F                               C
Merciful and Mighty!
Em                          Am
God in Three Persons,
Dm7            G7      C
Blessed Trinity!

[Verse 2]
C
Holy, Holy Holy!
F
All the saints adore Thee,
Em                                        Am
Casting down their golden crowns
D7		      G7
Around the glassy sea;
C
Cherubim and seraphim
F                                    C
falling down before Thee,
Em                               Am
Which wert and art and
Dm7       G7             C
evermore shalt be.

[Verse 3]
C
Holy, Holy Holy!
F
Tho' the darkness hide Thee,
Em                           Am
Tho' the eye of sinful man
D7		      G7
Thy glory may not see;
C
Only Thou art holy
F                                   C
there is none beside Thee,
Em                      Am
Perfect in pow'r, in
Dm7             G7      C
love and purity.

[Verse 4]
C
Holy, Holy Holy!
F
Lord God Almighty!
Em                                            Am
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
D7		           G7
In earth and sky and sea;
C
Holy, Holy, Holy!
F                               C
Merciful and Mighty
Em                          Am
God in Three Persons,
Dm7            G7      C
blessed Trinity!
