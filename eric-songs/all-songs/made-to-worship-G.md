# Made To Worship

[Intro]
G  C  G  C

[Verse 1]
G                          D/F#
Before the day, before the light
Em7                                                       C
before the world revolved around the sun
G                                            D/F#
God on High, stepped down into time
                       Em7                                      C    D
and wrote the story of His Love for everyone

[PreChorus]
Am7                          D
      He has filled our hearts with wonder
Am7                     C           D
       So that we always remember

[Chorus]
G
you and I are made to worship
C
you and I are called to love
Am7                                  Dsus4  D
you and I are forgiven and free
         G
when you and I embrace surrender
           C
when you and I choose to believe
       Am7            Dsus4
then you and I will see
                                        G  C
who we were meant to be

[Verse 2]
G                     D/F#
all we are and all we have
   Em7                                         C
is all a gift from God that we receive
G                                   D/F#
brought to life, we open up our eyes
                 Em7                                   C   D
to see the majesty and glory of the King

**PRECHORUS**

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
Am7                      G/B
even the rocks cry out
                              C
even the heavens shout
                              Am7    D
at the sound of His Holy Name
Am7                            G/B
so let every voice sing out
                                        C
and let every knee bow down
                     Am7/D     D
He is worthy of all our praise

[Chorus] [SOFTLY at first]
G
you and I are made to worship
C
you and I are called to love
Am7                                  Dsus4  D
you and I are forgiven and free
[BUILD UP]
         G
when you and I embrace surrender
           C
when you and I choose to believe
       Am7            Dsus4
then you and I will see, you and I will see

[Final Chorus]
G
you and I are made to worship
C
you and I are called to love
Am7                        Dsus4  D
you and I are forgiven and free
          G
when you and I embrace surrender
           C
when you and I choose to believe
      Am7            Dsus4
then you and I will see
                                     G  C  G  C
who we were meant to be
