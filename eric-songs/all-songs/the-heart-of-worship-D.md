# The Heart of Worship

[Intro]
D2  D2  D

[Verse 1]
		  A/C#	                               Em7(add2)
When the music fades, all is stripped away
	             Asus7 A7 	D2
And I simply come
		A/C#			    Em7(add2)
Longing just to bring, something that's of worth
	                             Asus7     A7
That will bless Your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Em	                D/F#	        A
I'll bring You more than a song,
              D/F#  Em   D   Em
For a song  in  it-self
	        D/F#		A  (A4 A)
Is not what You have required
Em		     D/F#	         A
You search much deeper within
                             D/F#    Em 	D       Em
Through the way things a - ppear
                                 D/F#	A  (A4 A)
You're looking into my heart

[Chorus]
D			A/C#
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
	Em7(add2)		G	Asus7 A7  D
And it's all about You, all about You Jesus
		              A/C#
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
                       Em7(add2)	   G                Asus7 A7  D2
When it's all about You, all about You Je-sus

A/C#    Em7(add2)   Asus7    A    D2

[Verse 2]
	               A/C#	                                  Em7(add2)
King of endless worth, no one could express
                                            Asus7 A7  D2
How much You deserve
 		               A/C#	 	Em7(add2)
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours
             	             Asus7 A7
Every single breath
