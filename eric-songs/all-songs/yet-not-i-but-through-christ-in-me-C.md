# Yet Not I But Through Christ In Me

[Verse 1]
C                   F
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer,
C               Am     Gsus  G
There is no more for heaven now to give
C                          F
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
C        G                  Csus   C
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace

[Chorus 1]
F                     C
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
F       C               Gsus  G
For my life is wholly bound to his
C              Dm         C/E          F
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
C/G             G         C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

C    F/A    C/E    F/A

[Verse 2]
C                     F
The night is dark, but I am not forsaken
C                 Am      Gsus  G
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
C                    F
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
C         Gsus  G     Csus    C
For in my need, His power is displayed

[Chorus 2] Piano Rhythm
C/E    F                        C
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
F       C              Gsus  G
Through the deepest valley He will lead
C              Dm         C/E       F
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
C/G             G         C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

C                     F
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
C                  Am       Gsus  G
The future sure, the price it has been paid
C                        F
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
C         Gsus  G       Csus  C
And He was raised to overthrow the grave

[Chorus 3]
C/E    F                       C
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
C/E   F       C          Gsus  G
Jesus now and ever is my plea
C            Dm            C          F
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
C/G             G         C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

C    F/A    C/E    F/A

[Verse 4]
C                        F
With every breath, I long to follow Jesus
C                 Am       Gsus G
For He has said that He will bring me home
C                    F
And day by day I know He will renew me
C          Gsus  G        Csus   C
Until I stand with joy before the throne

[Chorus 4]

All the glory evermore to Him

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

C/E    F                     C
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
C/E     F     C           Gsus  G
All the glory evermore to Him
C          Dm              C/E          F
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:
C/G             G         Csus  C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
