# Come As You Are

[Verse 1]
D
Come out of sadness
From wherever you've been
G
Come broken hearted
Let rescue begin
Bm
Come find your mercy
A
Oh sinner come kneel
G                            D
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
G                            D
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal

[Chorus]
         G
So lay down your burdens
         D
Lay down your shame
        Bm
All who are broken
        A
Lift up your face
       G
Oh wanderer come home
            D
You're not too far
         Bm                    A
So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart
         D
Come as you are

[Verse 2]
D
There's hope for the hopeless
And all those who've strayed
G
Come sit at the table
Come taste the grace
Bm
There's rest for the weary
A
Rest that endures
G                            D
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
G              D
Come as you are
Bm             A
Fall in His arms
G              D
Come as you are

**BRIDGE** x2

**CHORUS**

G              D
Come as you are
