# Heaven's Home

[Intro]
D  Em  G  A

[Verse 1]
D              Em           G                     A
When we wake up, look out of the window
D              Em           G                     A
All around us, the world seems grey
D              Em        G                    Bm
Then we look up, and we see the Saviour
       G                         Asus      A
The one who's given us this day

[Pre-Chorus]
          Gmaj7    A               Gmaj7    A
He's made it ready, you know the way
     Gmaj7/B   A/C#       Em7          A
The Father's house is where we'll stay

[Chorus]
A             G         A/C#         D          D/F#
He said, 'Don't worry – trust the Father
G     A/C#       D    D/F#
Also trust in me'
         G            A      D         A/C#       G/B   A
With eyes ahead, remember what he said
Em7                             A               D
Heaven's home is where we'll be

D  G/D  A/D  G/D x2

[Verse 2]
D              Em           G                     A
When we wake up, see the world is broken
D              Em           G                     A
There is suffering in every place
D              Em        G                    Bm
Then we look up, and we see the Saviour
       G                         Asus      A
The one who's given us his grace

**PRE-CHORUS**

**CHORUS**

D  Em  G  A x2

[Verse 3]
D              Em           G                     A
When we wake up, see the world against us
D              Em           G                     A
By his Spirit, we're not alone
D              Em        G                    Bm
So we look up, and we see the Saviour
       G                         Asus      A
The one who's given us his home

**PRE-CHORUS**

[Final Chorus]
A             G         A/C#         D          D/F#
He said, 'Don't worry – trust the Father
G     A/C#       D    D/F#
Also trust in me'
         G            A      D         A/C#       G/B   A
With eyes ahead, remember what he said
Em7                        A               D A Bm  A
Heaven's home is where we'll be
G                             A               D A Bm  A
Heaven's home is where we'll be
G                             A               D
Heaven's home is where we'll be
