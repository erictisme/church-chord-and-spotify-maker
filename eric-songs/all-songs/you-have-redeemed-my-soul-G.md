# You Have Redeemed My Soul

[Verse 1]
G                       C
You have redeemed my soul from death
        D               G
You have kept my feet from stumbling
G                       C
To walk before You in the land
        D               G
The land of the living

[Chorus]
C               D
You are my God, You are my God
G               Em
I will give thanks to You
C               D
You are my God, You are my God
G               G
I will give thanks to You

[Verse 2]
G                       C
And I will call upon Your Name
        D               G
You have heard my supplication
G                       C
Forever I will sing Your praise
        D               G
My God and my salvation

**CHORUS** x2
