# Though You Were Rich - D

[Verse 1]
           E                          C#m
Born a babe, a virgin birth
                   F#m                    G#/E                       B
My God the high and lofty One, You came to earth
           C#m         B              A
To be a slave, servant of all
              G#m        A                       B
You washed my feet, You took my fall

[Chorus]
                             E                          B
Though You were rich, You became poor
                         C#m                       A
That You would die, that I might live
                                  E                          B
You poured out Your soul even to death
                C#m                       A
Taking my sin just to forgive me

E B C#m A

[Verse 2]
                 E            B            C#m  B     F#m                  B
Then they led You down the road, To a hill called Calvary
                      C#m              G#m        A
You took the nails in Your hands and feet
        G#/E           F#m                  G#m                     B
You drank the cup of wrath that was reserved for me

[Chorus]
                             E                          B
Though You were rich, You became poor
                         C#m                       A
That You would die, that I might live
                                  E                          B
You poured out Your soul even to death
                C#m                       A
Taking my sin just to forgive me

E B C#m A

[Verse 3]
                 E                               C#m
Laid in the ground, a stone cold tomb
           B       F#m       G#/E             B
The wrath of God resting on You
                     C#m      B                   A
You knew no sin, yet sin became
           G#m     F#m                       G#/E                  B
From the foundation You are the Lamb who was slain

[Verse 4]
                     F#               C#     D#m
Up from the grave You rose again
        C#           G#m                        F#                                  C#
You hold the keys of death and hell, You've conquered sin
                     D#m    C#        B
You paid my debt, a costly price
                 G#m                       F#              C#
I know that I will be with You in Paradise

[Chorus]
                             E                          B
Though You were rich, You became poor
                         C#m                       A
That You would die, that I might live
                                  E                          B
You poured out Your soul even to death
                C#m                         A
Taking my sin just to forgive me x2
