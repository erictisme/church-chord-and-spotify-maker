# We Are the Church

[Intro]
B A E/G# G A

[Verse 1]
B
Before the world began
A
God made a masterplan
E
To bring all things together
A
Under one head
B
That head is Jesus Christ
A
Who died and rose to life
E
And now he's seated
A                 F#
At the right hand of God

[Verse 2]
B
Once we were dead in sin
A
Now we are raised with him
E
By grace we're saved, through faith
A
In Jesus alone
B
Part of his body now
A
United by his power
E
Joined with his people
A               F#
A-all over the world

[Chorus]
B
We are the church, have you heard?
A
He washed us clean with his word
E
He chose us to be on his team
G              A
We are more loved than we could dream
B
We've got good news, shout it out
A
You've got to hear what it's all about
E/G#
No-one's too far away to be
G            A                 B
Welcomed into God's family

A E/G# G A

[Verse 3]
B
Speaking the truth in love
A
To build the body up
E
We serve each other
A
Using gifts from the King
B
We pray for unity
A
So everyone will see
E
God's plan in action
A             F#
In his people today

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
B
One Lord, one faith
A
One God, one Father
E/G#
One body, one Spirit
A             B
We are one in Christ
B
One hope, one truth
A
One cross, one Saviour
E
One mission, one future
A                 B
We are one in Christ

**CHORUS**
