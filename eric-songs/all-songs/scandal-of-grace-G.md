# Scandal of Grace

[Verse 1]
E
Grace, what have you done?
C#m           A         E
Murdered for me on that cross
E
Accused in absence of wrong
C#m             A        E
My sin washed away in Your blood

[Pre-Chorus]
    G#m          A           E
Too much to make sense of it all
G#m             A             E
I know that Your love breaks my fall
    B                     C#m
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      A
So my soul will live

[Chorus]
         E
Oh to be like You
                         B
Give all I have just to know You
                        A
Jesus there's no one beside You
                       E     A
Forever the hope in my heart
C#m A

[Verse 2]
E
Death, where is your sting?
     C#m          A         E
Your power is as dead as my sin
E
The Cross has taught me to live
C#m       A                E
And mercy, my heart now to sing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
    G#m         A                  E
The day and its troubles shall come
G#m             A               E
I know that Your strength is enough
    B                     C#m
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      A
So my soul will live

**CHORUS**

         E
Oh to be like You
                         B
Give all I have just to know You
                        A
Jesus there's no one beside You
                       E A C# A
Forever the hope in my heart

**CHORUS** (loud then soft)

[Bridge]
A        E
And it's all because of You, Jesus
     B
It's all because of You, Jesus
     C#m
It's all because of Your love
        A
That my soul will live

**BRIDGE** x2

**CHORUS** x2
