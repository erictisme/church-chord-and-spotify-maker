# It Is Well With My Soul

[Verse 1]
C                       F       C
When peace like a river attendeth my way
                        G
When sorrows like sea billows roll
C               F       C
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say
        G               C
It is well, it is well with my soul

[Chorus]
        C               F       C
It is well (it is well)
                        G
With my soul (with my soul)
        C               F       C
It is well, it is well with my soul

[Verse 2]
C                       F       C
Though Satan should buffet though trials should come
                        G
Let this blest assurance control
C               F       C
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
        G               C
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
C                       F       C
My sin oh the bliss of this glorious thought
                        G
My sin not in part but the whole
C               F       C
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
        G               C
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord O my soul

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
C                       F       C
And Lord haste the day when the faith shall be sight
                        G
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
C               F       C
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
        G               C
Even so it is well with my soul

**CHORUS** x2
