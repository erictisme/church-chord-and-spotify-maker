# I Am Who You Say I Am

[Verse 1]
G
Who am I that the highest King
                                D
Would welcome me
Em
I was lost but He brought me in
                        C
Oh His love for me
G
Oh His love for me

[Chorus]
         C              G
Who the Son sets free
              Em    D
Oh is free indeed
        C              G
I'm a child of God
       D
Yes I am

[Verse 2]
G
Free at last, He has ransomed me
                            D
His grace runs deep
Em
While I was a slave to sin
                      C
Jesus died for me
G
Yes He died for me

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
C              G
In my Father's house
                 Em        D
There's a place for me
C              G
I'm a child of God
       D
Yes I am

**CHORUS** x2
