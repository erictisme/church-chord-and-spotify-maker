# Sinking Deep

[Intro]
G     Am     Em     C

[Verse 1]
G
Standing here in Your presence
G
In a grace so relentless
C             D
I am won by perfect love
G
Wrapped within arms of heaven
G
In a peace that last forever
C                 D
Sinking deep in mercy's sea

[Chorus]
     Am    Em     G              D
I'm wide awake, drawing close, stirred by grace
     Am     Em        D
And all my heart is Yours
     Am    Em         G                D
All fear removed, I breathe You in, I lean into
      C               G
Your love, oh Your love

**INTRO**

[Verse 2]
G
When I'm lost You pursue me
G
Lift my head to see Your glory
C                  D
Lord of all, so beautiful
G
Here in You, I find shelter
G
Captivated by the splendor
C                  D
of Your face, my secret place

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
       G                         Am
Your love so deep, it's washing over me
             Em                       C
Your face is all I seek, You are my everything
  G                       Am
Jesus Christ, You are my one desire
              Em                    C
Lord hear my only cry, to know You all my life

[Transition]
     Am    Em     G              D
I'm wide awake, drawing close, stirred by grace
     Am     Em        D
And all my heart is Yours
     Am    Em         G                D
All fear removed, I breathe You in, I lean into
      C
Your love

[Chorus - I could sing of your love] x2
G                    Am
I could sing of Your love forever
C                    D
I could sing of Your love forever
G                    Am
I could sing of Your love forever
C                    D
I could sing of Your love forever
