# When I Survey The Wondrous Cross - D

Verse 1
           D G              D
When I survey the wondrous cross
              Bm   Em         Asus  A
On which the Prince of glory died
           D/F#  G           Bm    G
My richest gain I count but  loss
             D   G    A       D              G  D/F# A
And pour contempt on all my pride

Verse 2
G              D  G               D
 See from His head His hands His feet
             Bm Em             Asus
Sorrow and love  flow mingled down
A         A G  D/F#G            Bm
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
G              D  G    A       D   G  D/F# A
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown

Verse 3
G              D  G               D
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
             Bm Em             Asus
That were an offering far too small
A         A G   D/F# G      Bm
 Love so amazing so divine
G            D  G    A       D   G  D/F# A
 Demands my soul my life my all
