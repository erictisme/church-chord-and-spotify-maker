# Grace Awaiting Me

[Verse 1]
A
I will see the world to come
F#m
For one has suffered in my place
D                                          A
Now there is grace awaiting me, awaiting me.
A
Judgement's done, atonement's made
F#m
The ransom's paid, no guilt remains
D
Now there is grace awaiting me, awaiting
A
me!

[Chorus]
D                                        F#m
Grace - a welcome from the Father
D                                         F#m
Grace - forgiveness full and free
D                                                  F#m
Grace - that's greater than our failings
E              D          A
Oh there is grace awaiting me

[Verse 2]
A
I take comfort in the hope
F#m
Of the thief upon the cross
D                                     A
For I am worthy of as little love as he.
A
Like this man, I won't despair
F#m
For life's ahead, what joy we'll share
D                                              A
Now there is grace awaiting me, awaiting me!

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
A                        E/G#
Jesus you have loved and bought me
F#m                        D
By your death my debts are paid
A                  E/G#
I am yours, I stand beside you
F#m                        D
Fearless face the coming day.

[Verse 3]
A
I will see the world to come
F#m
Despite the sin that I have done
D                                           A
For there is grace awaiting me, awaiting me.
A
All who call upon the Lord
F#m
Will rise to life with peace assured
D                                            A
For there is grace awaiting me, awaiting me.

**CHORUS**
