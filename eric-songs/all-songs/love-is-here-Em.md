# Love Is Here

[Intro]
Em     C    (x4)     D

[Verse 1]
Em          C        Em          C
Come to the Water, you who thirst
           Em          C    D
And you'll thirst no more
Em          C        Em          C
Come to the Father, you who toil
           Em          C    D
And you'll toil no more

[Pre-Chorus]
C               Em       C
To all you who labor in vain
D          Em         C
And to the broken and shamed

[Chorus]
        G             C
Love is here, Love is now
        Em               D               C
Love is pouring from His hands, from his brow
        G             D
Love is near, it satisfies
Em               D                C
Streams of mercy flowing from His side
              Em   G   C
Cause love is here

[Verse 2]
Em          C        Em          C
Come to the treasure, you who search
           Em          C    D
And you'll search no more
Em          C        Em          C
Come to the giver you who want
           Em          C    D
And you'll want no more

**PRE-CHORUS**

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
C
And to the bruised and fallen,
G/B
Captive, bound, and broken hearted
Am
He is the Lord
D
He is the Lord, yeah
C
By His death He's paid all ransom
G/B
From His wounds we drink salvation
Am
He is our Lord
D
He is our Lord

**CHORUS**
