# O Lord My Rock And My Redeemer

[Verse 1]
D                  G        D
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
G        D            A
Greatest treasure of my longing soul
D            Bm      G      D
My God, like You there is no other
G         D          A         D
True delight is found in You alone

[Verse 2]
D                  G        D
Your grace, a well too deep to fathom
G          D           A
Your love exceeds the heavens' reach
D            Bm      G      D
Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom
G            D       A       D
My highest good and my unending need

[Chorus]
     G          A       D
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
G         D           A
Strong defender of my weary heart
D              Bm    G     D
My sword to fight the cruel deceiver
G      D            A        D
And my shield against his hateful darts
Bm       G       D        A
My song when enemies surround me
Bm       G        A    D
My hope when tides of sorrow rise
Bm       G       D        A
My joy when trials are abounding
G         D          A      D
Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night

[Verse 3]
D                  G        D
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
G         D           A
Gracious Savior of my ruined life
D            Bm      G      D
My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders
G         D       A       D
In my place You suffered bled and died

[Verse 4]
D                  G        D
You rose, the grave and death are conquered
G          D          A
You broke my bonds of sin and shame
D            Bm      G      D
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
G       D      A       D
May all my days bring glory to Your Name

**CHORUS** x2
