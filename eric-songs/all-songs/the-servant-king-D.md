# The Servant King

Capo 2

[Intro]
C C/F  C  C/F

[Verse 1]
Am                          E7                  Fmaj7
From heaven You came a helpless babe
G              C         Dm    C   G7
Entered our world Your glory veiled
Am                 E7                        Fmaj7
Not to be served but to serve
G              C         Dm    C   G7
And give Your life that we might live

[Chorus]
         C      E7              Am
This is our God, the Servant King
         F             G7           C      G7
He calls us now to follow Him
          C                   C7              F   B7
To bring our lives as a daily offering
         C   G              C       (E7)
Of worship to the Servant King

[Verse 2]
Am                          E7                  Fmaj7
There in the garden of tears
G              C         Dm    C   G7
My heavy load He chose to bear
Am                 E7                        Fmaj7
His heart with sorrow was torn
G              C         Dm    C   G7
 "Yet not my will but Yours", He said

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
Am                          E7                  Fmaj7
Come and see His hands and His feet
G              C         Dm    C   G7
The scars that speak of sacrifice
Am                 E7                        Fmaj7
Hand that flung stars into space
G              C         Dm    C   G7
To cruel nails surrendered

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
Am                          E7                  Fmaj7
So let us learn how to serve
G              C         Dm    C   G7
And in our lives enthrone Him
Am                 E7                        Fmaj7
Each other's needs to prefer
G              C         Dm    C   G7
For it is Christ we're serving

**CHORUS (slow)**

[Last line]
         C   G              Am   G    F
Of worship to the Servant King
         C   G              C
Of worship to the Servant King
