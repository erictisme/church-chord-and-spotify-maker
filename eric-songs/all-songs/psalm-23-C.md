# Psalm 23 (C)

## Verse 1
```
C
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want
C
In green pastures He makes me lie down
C
He restores my soul
And leads me on for His Name
For His great Name
```

## Chorus
```
C
Surely goodness, surely mercy
Right beside me all my days
And I will dwell in Your house forever
And bless Your Holy Name
```

## Verse 2
```
C
You prepare a table right before me
In the presence of my enemies
Though the arrow flies
And the terror of night is at my door
I'll trust you Lord
```

## Bridge
```
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
You are on my side
```
