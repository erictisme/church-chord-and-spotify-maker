# Who Am I

[Verse 1]
       A           E               F#m
Who am I? That the Lord of all the earth,
      E               D           E               D
Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt,
       A           E                  F#m
Who am I? That the Bright and Morning Star,
      E                   D           E              D
Would choose to light the way, For my ever wandering heart,

[Pre-Chorus]
    F#m               E       D                      E
Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,
    F#m                   E         D                  E
Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are,

[Chorus]
A      E              F#m           E              D
I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
  E                  D                             A
A wave tossed in the ocean (ocean), a vapor in the wind,
          E                F#m                 E                 D
Still You hear me when I'm calling, Lord, You catch me when I'm falling,
           E             D
And You've told me who I am..
     A
I am Yours.

[Verse 2]
       A          E                F#m
Who am I? That the eyes that see my sin,
      E               D         E             D
Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again,
       A           E                     F#m
Who am I? That the voice that calmed the sea,
      E                    D         E                 D
Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me,
