# I Stand Amazed (How Marvelous)

[Intro]
E  A2  C#m  B

[Verse 1]
E
I stand amazed in the presence
B             A2    E
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
A2                               E/G#
And wonder how He could love me,
E                B                E
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[Chorus]
E
Singing how marvelous! How wonderful!
B
And my song shall ever be
E              B/D#  C#m7
How marvelous! How wonderful!
F#m7 E/G#     Bsus B  E
Is my Savior's love for me!

**VERSE 1**

**CHORUS**

E  A2  C#m  B

[Verse 2]
E
He took my sins and my sorrows,
B                     A2      E
He made them His very own;
A2                          E/G#
He bore the burden to Calvary,
E                  B       E
And suffered and died alone.

**CHORUS** x2

[Verse 3]
[Softly]
E
When with the ransomed in glory
B                  A2     E
His face I at last shall see,
[Build up]
A2                               E/G#
Twill be my joy through the ages
E               B           E
To sing of His love for me.

**CHORUS** x2
