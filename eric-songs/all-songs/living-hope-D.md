# Living Hope

[Intro]
D G D G

[Verse 1]
              D                A
How great the chasm that lay between us
             G        Bm            A
How high the mountain I could not climb
        D                              A
In desperation I turned to heaven
                            G      A            D
And spoke Your name into the night
                              G
Then through the darkness Your loving kindness
D
Tore through the shadows of my soul
                    Bm                   A
The work is finished, the end is written
             G              A         D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

(D) G

[Verse 2]
                   D                             A
Who could imagine so great a mercy
                              G          Bm
What heart could fathom such boundless grace
A
The God of ages stepped down from glory
                    A
To wear my sin and bear my shame
                    G           A             D
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
                         G                      D
The King of Kings calls me His own
                  Bm                           A
Beautiful Savior I'm Yours forever
                    D                           A
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope
                G              A       D

[Chorus]
      G D                        A                        Bm
Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
         G D                   A                     Bm
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
                 G                  D
You have broken every chain, there's salvation in Your Name
A                           Bm
             G              A        D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope x2

(D) G

[Verse 3]
              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        D
Declared the grave has no claim on me

              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        Bm  (D/F#)
Declared the grave has no claim on me
       G            A    D
Jesus, Yours is the victory

**CHORUS** x2

      G          A      Bm    D/F#
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope
      G          A      Bm    D/F#
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope
            G      A      D
Oh God, You are my Living Hope
