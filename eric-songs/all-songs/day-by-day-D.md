# Day By Day

[Verse 1]
D                                 Em
Day by day, and with each passing moment,
A       A7             D
Strength I find to meet my trials here
d                      G
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment
A        A7           D
I've no cause for worry or for fear
G
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure
A        A7                                   D
Gives unto each day what He deems best
D                                 Em
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure
A          A7               D
Mingling toil with peace and rest

[Verse 2]
D                                  Em
Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
A                  A7              D
With a special mercy for each hour;
D                              G
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
A        A7            D
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.
G
The protection of His child and treasure
A        A7                          D
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;

D                           G
"As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
A               A7          D
This the pledge to me He made.

[Verse 3]
D                      Em
Help me then, in every tribulation,
A                A7         D
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
D                                       G
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
A                  A7        D
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
D                                        G
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
A                  A7              D
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
D                             G
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
A          A7      D
Till with Christ the Lord I stand.
