(All Instruments Start To Enter)
C         Am   G
Holy, Holy, Holy,
F                    C
Lord God Almighty!
Em                       Am
Early in the morning,
           D7                  G7
Our song shall rise to Thee;
C         Am   G
Holy, Holy, Holy!
F                     C
Merciful and Mighty!
Em                          Am
God in Three Persons,
Dm7            G7      C
Blessed Trinity!

[Verse 2]
C         Am   G
Holy, Holy Holy!
F                        C
All the saints adore Thee,
Em                               Am
Casting down their golden crowns
        D7              G7
Around the glassy sea;
C         Am          G
Cherubim and seraphim
F                           C
falling down before Thee,
Em                          Am
Which wert and art and

evermore shalt be.

Tho' the darkness hide Thee,
Em                           Am
Tho' the eye of sinful man
           D7              G7
Thy glory may not see;
C         Am       G
Only Thou art holy

F                                   C
there is none beside Thee,

Em                      Am
Perfect in pow'r, in

love and purity.

All Thy works shall praise Thy name

In earth and sky and sea;
C         Am   G
Holy, Holy, Holy!
F                               C
Merciful and Mighty

God in Three Persons,

blessed Trinity!
