                   C2
In the name of the Father, In the name of the Son

In the name of the Spirit, Lord we come
               Am
We're gathered together, To lift up Your Name
               F                                   C2
To call on our Savior, To fall on Your grace

In the name of the Father, In the name of the Son
                  F
In the name of the Spirit, Lord we come
              Am
We're gathered together, To lift up Your Name

To call on our Savior, To fall on Your grace

[Pre-Chorus]

Hear the joyful sound of our offering
        Gsus
As Your saints bow down, as Your people sing

We will rise with You, Lifted on Your wings
        F
And the world will see that

There is hope

In Your name
