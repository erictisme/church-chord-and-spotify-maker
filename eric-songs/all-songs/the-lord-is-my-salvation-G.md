# The Lord is My Salvation

[Intro]
G C G C

[Verse 1]
Em                  C                           Dsus  D
The grace of God has reached for me
Em                     C                 Dsus     D
and pulled me from the raging sea;
C/E            D/F#            G G/B  C
and I am safe on this solid ground,
Am7                D       C/G
the Lord is my salvation.

[Verse 2]
Em          C                              Dsus     D
I will not fear when darkness falls,
Em                        C
His strength will help me scale these
Dsus      D
walls;
C/E             D/F#            G  G/B C
I'll see the dawn of the rising sun,
Am7                 D       C/G    G/D
the Lord is my salvation.

[Chorus]
D                    C            G/B
Who is like the Lord our God,
D                             C      G/B
strong to save, faithful in love?
Em    D/F#               G   G/B C
my debt is paid, and the victory won;
Am7               D   G      D G D
the Lord is my salvation.

[Verse 3]
Em                C                  Dsus   D
My hope is hidden in the Lord,
Em                         C                    Dsus   D
He flowers each promise of His word;
C/E                   D/F#                G   G/B  C
when winter fades, I know spring will come,
Am7                D     C/G   G/D
the Lord is my salvation.

[Verse 4]
Em              C                       Dsus    D
In times of waiting, times of need,
Em                  C                       Dsus    D
when I know loss, when I am weak,
C/E               D/F#           G   G/B  C
I know His grace will renew these days;
Am7               D       C/G   G/D
the Lord is my salvation.

And when I reach my final day,

He will not leave me in the grave;
C/E           D/F#           G  G/B C
but I will rise, He will call me home.
Am7           D     C/G   G/D
The Lord is my salvation.
