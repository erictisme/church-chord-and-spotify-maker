God of creation There at the start

Before the beginning of time
G                                      Bm
With no point of reference You spoke to the dark

A hundred billion galaxies are born
                                                   D#/F
In the vapour of Your breath the planets
G
Form

If the stars were made to worship so will I

A
 Made
                                 D/F#             G
Every burning star A signal fire of grace

If creation sings Your praises so will I
          A
So will I ~

VERSE 2
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

CHORUS 2
                           D
And as You speak
                            Bm
A hundred billion creatures catch Your
      A
Breath
                    D/F#                       G
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
      Bm                    G                   D
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
                                     Bm                       A
I can see Your heart in everything You say
                                 D/F#                 G
Every painted sky A canvas of Your grace
    Bm              G                          D
If creation still obeys You so will I

BRIDGE (Chill)
          G
If the stars were made to worship
           Bm A6
so will I
REPEAT CHORDS G Bm A6
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
(Build)
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
(Express)
         G
If the wind goes where You send it
           Bm A/D
so will I
REPEAT CHORDS G Bm A/D
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

VERSE 3 (Chill)
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

CHORUS 3
(Chill)
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
(Build)
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
(Express)
I can see Your heart
Eight billion different ways
Every precious one
A child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

TAG (Guitar + hold strings)
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind
