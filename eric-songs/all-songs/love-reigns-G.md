# Love Reigns

[Intro]
Em  C  G
Em  C  G

[Verse 1]
                Em         D       G
We live to love and to be loved.
                   Em         D        G
A hand to hold, a heart, a home.
                            Em               D                G
From life's first breath to the end of our days.
                   Am                        D
Cradled in love; or else we wilt away.

[Chorus]
              G            Em               Bm     D
Oh how beautiful; precious the gift.
                    G                    Em            Bm    D
When love reigns, and it's all that remains.
          G       Bm     C           Em
For you and I, as time rolls by.
           C              D            G
Love reigns; it's all that remains.

[Verse 2]
                  Em          D           G
We look around and look within.
                   Em                D        G
Our souls adrift, broken up and worn.
                     Em         D                G
We look for hope, we look to the cross,
                 Am                                  D
Abiding in love; help us Lord, we pray.

**CHORUS**

C  Bm/G  D
C  Bm/G  D

[Refrain] x3
                 C   Bm/G   D
From his heart to yours
                      C   Bm/G   D
And my love endures

[Bridge]
                C   Bm/G   D
So we'll love and pray.
              C   Bm/G   D
Let this love be true.
                              Am
Oh Lord let your love reign.
        D                      Em        D
Let love be all that remains.

**CHORUS** x2
