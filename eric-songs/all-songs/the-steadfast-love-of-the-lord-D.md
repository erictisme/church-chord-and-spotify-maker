# The Steadfast Love Of The Lord

D                                       A7
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
    G                                   D
His mercies never come to an end
                                        A7
They are new every morning, new every morning
G           A7      D
Great is Thy faithfulness, O Lord
G           A7      D
Great is Thy faithfulness
