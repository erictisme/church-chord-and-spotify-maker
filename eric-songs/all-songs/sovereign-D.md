[Intro]
D Bm G Bm A

[Verse]
D
Sovereign in the mountain air
Bm
Sovereign on the ocean floor
G
With me in the calm

With me in the storm

Sovereign in my greatest joy
Bm
Sovereign in my deepest cry

With me in the dark

With me at the dawn

[Chorus]

In your everlasting arms

All the pieces of my life
                                    Bm
From beginning to the end

I can trust you
D                                 Bm
In your never failing love

You work everything for good
                                         Bm
God whatever comes my way
        A
I will trust you

Held in your hands

All my fears, all my dreams
