# Jireh

[Verse 1]
E
I'll never be more loved than I am right now
B
Wasn't holding You up so there's nothing I can do to let You down
C#m
Doesn't take a trophy to make You proud
A
I'll never be more loved than I am right now

[Verse 2]
E
Going through a storm but I won't go down
B
I hear Your voice carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out
C#m
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
A
You've never been closer than You are right now

[Chorus]
E                B
Jireh, You are enough
C#m              A
Jireh, You are enough
E                        B
And I will be content in every circumstance
C#m       A
Jireh, You are enough

[Bridge]
E
I'm already loved, I'm already chosen
B
I know who I am, I know what You've spoken
C#m
I'm already loved more than I could imagine
A
And that is enough

**BRIDGE** x2

**CHORUS**

[Tag]
E                B
If He dresses the lilies
C#m              A
With beauty and splendor
E                B
How much more will He clothe you
C#m              A
How much more will He clothe you

**TAG** x2

**CHORUS**
