# As The Deer

[Verse 1]
D          G       D
As the deer panteth for the water
   G       D       A7
So my soul longeth after Thee
D           G         D
You alone are my heart's desire
       Bm  A7      D
And I long to worship Thee

[Chorus]
G               D       A7
You alone are my strength my shield
D               G       Em      A7
To You alone may my spirit yield
D           G       D
You alone are my heart's desire
       Bm  A7      D
And I long to worship Thee

[Verse 2]
D          G       D
You're my friend and You are my brother
   G       D       A7
Even though You are a King
D           G         D
I love You more than any other
   Bm      A7      D
So much more than anything

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
D          G       D
I want You more than gold or silver
   G       D       A7
Only You can satisfy
D           G         D
You alone are the real joy giver
       Bm  A7      D
And the apple of my eye

**CHORUS**
