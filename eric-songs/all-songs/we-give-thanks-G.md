# We Give Thanks

[Intro]
C G Em D
C G Em D

[Verse 1]
      C        G    Em     D
Once in the wilderness of our sin
          C        G       D
We wandered lost and without hope
                   C      G     Em     D
Into our desert waste God in grace
                     C           G        D
Came to restore and bring us home
                    Am7           G/B         C
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

[Chorus]
                C                G              Em       D
We give thanks, O God, for Your steadfast love
                C               G                         Em
We give thanks, O God, for You are good
         D                                       C      G   Em   D
Lord, You are good, we give thanks

[Verse 2]
              C        G      Em     D
Through every pain and trial, You provide
             C       G      D
Light in the dark of our distress
           C       G    Em      D
Lifting us from on high when we cry
            C        G       D
Turning our grief to gratefulness
          Am7           G/B         C
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

[Chorus]
        C         G              Em       D
We give thanks, O God, for Your steadfast love
        C         G                Em
We give thanks, O God, for You are good
              D
Lord, You are good,
        C         G              Em       D
We give thanks, O God, for Your steadfast love
         C        G                Em
We give thanks, O God, for You are good
             D              C
Lord, You are good, we give thanks

[Instrumental]
     G   Em   D
 C   G   Em   D

[Bridge]
             Am7                     C
You take the darkness and make it as light
                 G                         D
Hearts that were dead in sin, You raise to life
           Am7                         C
You take a barren place and make it a spring
          G                         D
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing
          Am7           G/B         C
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing!
