E          A          E
Bless the Lord, O my soul,

O my soul,
A             E    Bsus4 B
Worship His holy name.
A        C#m
Sing like never before,

0 my soul.

I'll worship Your holy name.

[Verse 1]
A         E           B       C#m
The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
A            E            B     C#m
It's time to sing Your song again.
A            E              B           C#m
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
A2         E                Bsus4 B  E   Esus4 E
Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 2]
A       E                B        C#m
You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
A       E               B         C#m
Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
A        E               B       C#m
For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
A2           E             Bsus4 B  E    Esus4 E
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
A       E           B            C#m
And on that day when my strength is failing,
A         E            B         C#m
The end draws near, and my time has come;

A        E                   B        C#m
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
A2           E                 Bsus4  B  E  Esus4 E
Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!

A             E    Bsus4 B
Worship His holy name.
A        C#m
Sing like never before,
A B  C#m
0 my soul.
