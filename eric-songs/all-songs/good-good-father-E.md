# Good Good Father

[Intro]
E

[Verse 1]
E
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
E
Of what they think You're like
E
But, I've heard the tender whisper
E
Of love in the dead of night
A          E/G#
And You tell me that You're pleased
F#m          B
And that I'm never alone

[Chorus]
A
You're a Good, Good Father
E
It's who You are
F#m
It's who You are
B
It's who you are
A
And I'm loved by You
E/G#
It's who I am
F#m
It's who I am
B
It's who I am

[Verse 2]
E
Oh, and I've seen many searching
E
For answers far and wide
E
But I know we're all searching
E
For answers only You provide
A        E/G#
Cause You know just what we need
F#m          B
Before we, say a word

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
A                              C#m
Cause You are perfect in all of your ways
F#m                           E
You are perfect in all of your ways
A                             C#m      B
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
A                            C#m
You are perfect in all of your ways
F#m                          E
Oh, You're perfect in all of your ways
A                             C#m        B
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

[Verse 3]
E
Oh, it's a love so undeniable
E
I, I can hardly speak
E
Peace so unexplainable
E [Diamond]
I, I can hardly think
A          E/G#
As You call me deeper still
F#m       E/G#
As You call me deeper still
A          E/G#
As You call me deeper still
F#m           B
And to love, love, love

**CHORUS** x2
