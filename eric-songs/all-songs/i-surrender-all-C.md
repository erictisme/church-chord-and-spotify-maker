# I Surrender All

[Verse 1]
C               G
All to Jesus I surrender
Am   F        G       C
All to Him I freely give
C             G
I will ever love and trust him,
Am    F             G      C
In His presence daily live

[Chorus]
C              Dm G                C
I surrender all, I surrender all
C                       Am         F      C
All to thee, my blessed Savior, I
G            C
surrender all.

[Verse 2]
C            G
All to Jesus I surrender,
Am     F      G      C
Humbly at His feet I bow,
C                 G
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Am       F      G       C
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
C            G
All to Jesus I surrender,
Am       F       G      C
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
C               G
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Am    F         G        C
Truly know that Thou art mine.

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
C            G
All to Jesus I surrender,
Am      F    G         C
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
C                G
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Am      F        G       C
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

**CHORUS** x2
