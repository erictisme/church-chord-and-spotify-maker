# You Hold Me Now

[Intro]
G  C  Em  C x2

[Verse 1]
        G
On that day when I see
         C            G
All that You have for me
        Em
When I see You face to face
      Bm                D
There surrounded by Your grace
       G
All my fears swept away
       C             G
In the light of Your embrace
           Em
Where Your love is all I need
    Bm          D
And forever I am free

[Pre Chorus 1]
          Am
Where the streets are made of gold
        G/A
In Your presence healed and whole
        C
Let the songs of heaven rise to You alone

[Chorus]
(Diamond)
G              C          Em
    No weeping no hurt or pain
                 C
No suffering You hold me now You hold me now
G                  C       Em
    No darkness no sick or lame
              C
No hiding You hold me now You hold me now

G  C  Em  C

[Verse 2]
        G
In this life I will stand
     	    C            G
Through my joy and my pain
    	    Em
Knowing there's a greater day
   	   Bm                D
There's a hope that never fails
       G
Where Your Name is lifted high
       C             G
And forever praises rise
           Em
For the glory of Your Name
    Bm          D
I'm believing for the day

[Pre Chorus 2]
          Am
Where the wars and violence cease
        G/A
All creation lives in peace
        C
Let the songs of heaven
Rise to You alone

**CHORUS**

  All my heart will give
Am                      C
