So much expectation

From the throne of Heaven

To that lowly manger bed

The word became flesh

[Chorus]

The joy of Christmas, Light of the world
G
The King of heaven, come down to earth
Am	     F
We sing hallelujah

The Gift of Love, Salvation is here
Am     	    F
We sing hallelujah

Promised messiah, Lord of Lords

We stand in awe and wonder

Join with the angels and we sing

Hark the herald angels sing

Glory to the newborn king
Am     F
Hallelujah

Peace on earth and mercy mild

God and sinners reconciled
