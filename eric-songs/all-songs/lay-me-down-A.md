# Lay Me Down

CAPO 2

[Intro]
Em7   D/F#   G

[Verse 1]
           Em7
With this heart open wide
D/F#       G
From the depths

From the heights
         Em7    D    G
I will bring a sacrifice
            Em7
With these hands lifted high
D/F#      G
Hear my song

Hear my cry
         Em7    D    G
I will bring a sacrifice
         Em7    D    C2   G
I will bring a sacrifice

[Chorus]
C2       G
I lay me down
           D
I'm not my own
    Em7     D    C2
I belong to You alone
       G
Lay me down
       D
Lay me down, oh
C2         G
Hand on my heart
             D
This much is true
           Em7   D         C2
There's no life apart from You
       G
Lay me down
       D    Em7   D/F#   G
Lay me down

[Verse 2]
        Em7
Letting go of my pride
D/F#    G
Giving up all my rights
           Em7      D       G
Take this life and let it shine
           Em7      D/F#     C2   G
Take this life and let it shine

**CHORUS**

C2     G
Lay me down
       D    G2
Lay me down

[Bridge]
              G2
It will be my joy to say

Your will, Your way
              Em7
It will be my joy to say

Your will, Your way
              Dsus
It will be my joy to say
 C2
Your will, Your way
 G2
Always
