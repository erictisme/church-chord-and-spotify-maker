# When I Survey The Wondrous Cross

[Intro]
Gm

[Verse 1]
        Gm                        D
When I survey the wondrous cross
        Cm              Gm
On which the Prince of glory died
   Cm              Gm
My richest gain I count but loss
    Eb              D
And pour contempt on all my pride

[Verse 2]
         Gm                D
Forbid it Lord that I should boast
       Cm              Gm
Save in the death of Christ my God
    Cm              Gm
All the vain things that charm me most
  Eb                  D
I sacrifice them to His blood

[Verse 3]
       Gm              D
See from His head His hands His feet
       Cm              Gm
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
     Cm              Gm
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
   Eb              D
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

[Verse 4 - Key change to C]
         C               G
Were the whole realm of nature mine
       F               C
That were a present far too small
     F               C
Love so amazing so divine
    F               G       C
Demands my soul my life my all

[Chorus]
C               F       C
Oh the wonderful cross
F       G       C
Oh the wonderful cross
Am      F       C
Bids me come and die
    F       G
And find that I may truly live
C               F       C
Oh the wonderful cross
F       G       C
Oh the wonderful cross
Am      F       C
All who gather here
       F       G       C
By grace draw near and bless Your name

**VERSE 4**

**CHORUS** x2

[Tag]
       F       G       C
Always only Jesus
