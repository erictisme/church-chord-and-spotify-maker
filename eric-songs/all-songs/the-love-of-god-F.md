# The Love of God

[Intro]
F    G              Am            G

[Verse 1]
C
The love of God is greater far
               G            C
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
        C
It goes beyond the highest star
            G             C
And reaches to the lowest hell
           F                     C
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
             G      C
God gave His Son to win
           F              C
His erring child, He reconciled
             G        C
And pardoned from his sin

[Verse 2]
              C
Could we with ink, the ocean fill
             G                   C
And were the skies, of parchment made
           C
Were every stalk on earth a quill
          G                C
And every man, a scribe by trade
             F           C
To write the love of God above
                G     C
Would drain the ocean dry
              F                  C
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
                      G      Am F   Am F
Though stretched from sky to sky

[Refrain]
             F           C
Oh love of God how rich and pure
                G     C
How measureless and strong
              F                  C
It shall forevermore endure
                      G      Am F   Am F
The saints and angels song

[Verse 3]
              C
When years of time shall pass away,
             G                   C
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
           C
When men, who here refuse to pray,
          G                C
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
             F           C
God's love so sure, shall still endure,
                G     C
All measureless and strong;
              F                  C
Redeeming grace to Adam's race—
             G        C
The saints' and angels' song.
