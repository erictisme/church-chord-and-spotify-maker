# Jesus Paid It All

[Intro]
C  F  Dm  (C/E)  F  x2

[Verse 1]
C            Am
I hear the Saviour say
F                       C
Thy strength indeed is small.
(B) Am                     F
Child of weakness watch and pray
C            G       C
Find in me thine all in all.

[Chorus]
C             Am
Jesus paid it all.
C             G
All to Him I owe.
C             F  C/E  Dm
Sin had left a crimson stain,
C             G        C
He washed it white as snow.

C  F  Dm  (C/E)  F

[Verse 2]
C            Am
Lord now indeed I find
F               C
Thy power and thine alone
(B) Am                     F
Can change the lepers spots
C              G         C
And melt the heart of stone

**CHORUS** x2

C  F  Dm  (C/E)  F

[Refrain]
C                   F
Oh praise the one who paid my debt
Dm                   C/E   F
And raised this life up from the dead. (x4)

C  F  Dm  (C/E)  F

[Verse 3]
C            Am
And when before the throne
F               C
I stand in him complete
(B) Am                     F
Jesus died my soul to save
C           G         C
My lips shall still repeat

**CHORUS**
