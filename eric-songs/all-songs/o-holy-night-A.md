# O Holy Night

[Intro]
A E F#m D x2

[Verse 1]
A            E            D                          F#m
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
D               E7                 A
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
A                  E            D                   F#m
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
C#m                 G#7           C#m
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
E7   (Cello enter)  A
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
E7                       A
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

[Chorus 1]
F#m             C#m       Bm                   F#m
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
A   E7  A  D     A E7
O night divine, O night when Christ was
A
Born!
E7      A  D      A E7                  A
O night divine, O night, O night divine!

A E F#m D x2

[Verse 3]
A              E                D                F#m
Truly He taught'us to love one another;
D                  E7           A
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
A                       E                     D
Chains shall He break for the slave is our
F#m
brother (and sister)
C#m           G#7                 C#m
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.

E7  (Scale)        A
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
E7                A
Let all within us praise His holy Name!

[Chorus 2]
(E) F#m             C#m (D# E)
Christ is the Lord,
Bm                       F#m
Oh praise His name forever,
A E7         A D  A E7            A
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
E7             A D
His pow'r and glory
A     E7          A
Evermore proclaim.

**CHORUS 1**

A E F#m D x1
