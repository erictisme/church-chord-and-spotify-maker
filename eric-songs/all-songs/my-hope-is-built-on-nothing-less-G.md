# My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less

[Intro]
G A F#/D G x2

[Verse 1]
     G                        A
My hope is built on nothing less
          Em                      G
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
  G                         A
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
       Em                   G
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

[Chorus]
     D                       Em
On Christ the solid rock I stand
      F#/D                 G        A
All other ground is sinking sand
     Bm                    A           G    A F#/D G
All other ground is sinking sand

G A F#/D G

[Verse 2]
          G                              A
When darkness seems to hide his face
  Em                 G
I rest on his unchanging grace
   G                        A
In every high and stormy gale
       Em                   G
My anchor holds within the veil

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
     G               A
His oath, his covenant, his blood
       Em                  G
Support me in the whelming flood
          G                     A
When all around my soul gives way
     Em                 G
He then is all my hope and stay

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
          D                            D
When he shall come with trumpet sound
     D                    Bm
Oh may I then in him be found
               D                     D
Dressed in his righteousness alone
        D                      G
Faultless to stand before the throne

**CHORUS**
