[Verse 1]
D                                     G                        D
We won't fear the battle, we won't fear the night
G                        D        Bm                    A
We will walk the valley with You by our side
D                                G                         D
You will go before us, You will lead the way
G                         D          Bm                A
We have found a refuge, only You can save

[Chorus]
D                          G                D
Sing with joy now: our God is for us
G                      D         Bm                      A
The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
D                                 G                D
Raise your voice now, no love is greater
G                      D                          A
Who can stand against us if our God is for us

[Verse 2]
D                                 G                  D
Even when I stumble, even when I fall
G                   D              Bm                      A
Even when I turn back, still Your love is sure
D                                G                    D
You will not abandon, You will not forsake
G                           D                 Bm             A
You will cheer me onward with never-ending grace

He who gave His son to free us
