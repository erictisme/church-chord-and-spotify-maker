     A
I serve a risen Saviour, He's in the world today;
      A                      E/G#       F#m                  B7                            E7
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;
    A                                                                A                    D                     A
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,
               A               E/G#           F#m                    B7                         E7
And just the time I need Him, He's always near.
