[Verse 1]
D                       C                           G
We are looking forward to a better day
D                            C                        G
When all pain and crying is taken away

No more sin or darkness
D                             C
Every wrong made right

Jesus Christ is coming and he is the light

[Chorus]
                     G        C
He's coming back again
                    C              D
Because he promised to
                     G        C
He's coming back again
                      C  G/B D/A
He will make all things new
              G           C
Jesus is coming back
                   C          D
To bring his people home
                     G       C
He's coming back again
                   C G/B    Am     D    G
And we will worship round his throne

[Verse 2]
We know it is certain because God has said
He is sending Jesus, who rose from the dead
Now the judge is coming
He will deal with sin
And he'll save his people so we'll be with him

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
There'll be celebrations when we see our King
People from all nations will be joining in
Every race and colour
One big family
Praising Christ who saved us for eternity

**CHORUS**
