# Angels We Have Heard On High

[Intro]
C… C… G Am… Am… G

[Verse 1]
C                        G              C
Angels we have heard on high,
G             C
sweetly singing o'er the plains
C                            G    C
And the mountains in reply,
C                    G           C
echoing their joyous strains

[Chorus]
C Dm
C G G7
Gloria . . .
C               G G7
in excelsis Deo
C Dm
C G G7
Gloria . . .
C               G G7 C
in excelsis Deo

C… C… G Am… Am… G

[Verse 2]
C                               G    C
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
G             C
Why your joyous strains prolong?
C                              G         C
What the gladsome tidings be
C                             G            C
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

**CHORUS**

[Verse 4]
C            G      C
See Him in a manger laid,
G                C
Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth
G              C
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
G            C
while our hearts in love we raise

**CHORUS**

C… C… G Am… Am… G C
