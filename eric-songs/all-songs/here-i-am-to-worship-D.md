# Here I Am to Worship

[Verse 1]
D               A                             Em
Light of the world, you stepped down into
G              D              A                G
darkness, open my eyes, let me see
D           A         Em     G
Beauty that made this heart adore you,
  D         A              G
 hope of a life spent with you

[Chorus]
      		D                                   A
And here I am to worship Here I am to bow down
        D/F#                 G
Here I am to say that you're my God
                            D                           A
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
        D/F#          G
 altogether wonderful to me

[Verse 2]
D           A         Em       G
King of all days O so highly exalted,
D           A       G
glorious in Heaven a-bove
D          A           Em           G
Humbly you came to the earth you created,
  D              A          G
 all for love's sake became poor

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
      A     D/F#             G
I'll never know how much it cost to
A      D/F#  G
see my sin upon that cross

**BRIDGE**

**CHORUS** x2
