[Verse 1]
D                      Em - D/F#  G           D
How deep the Father's love for us, how vast
Bm  A
beyond all measure
D                       Em - D/F#  G       D
That he should give his only son, to make a
A    D
wretch his treasure
Bm                                 G             D
How great the pain of searing loss, the Father
Bm    A
turned his face away
D                               Em - D/F#  G
As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring
D                   A
many ones to glory

[Verse 2]
D               Em - D/F#  G
Behold the man upon a cross,

my sin upon his shoulders
D                          Em - D/F#  G
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
D                     A   D
call out among the scoffers
Bm                                     G
It was my sin that held him there
D                   Bm     A
until it was accomplished
Bm                   Em - D/F#  G
His dying breath has brought me life;
D                   A
I know that it is finished

[Instrumental]
Bm  A  D x4

[Verse 3] (Build)
D                      Em - D/F#  G
I will not boast in anything:
D                            Bm  A
no gifts, no power, no wisdom
Bm                               G
But I will boast in Jesus Christ;
D                     A  D
his death and resurrection

Bm                    Em - D/F#  G
Why should I gain from his reward?
D                     Bm   A
I cannot give an answer
Bm                                   G
But this I know with all my heart:
D                            A  D
his wounds have paid my ransom

SOFT
Bm                                     G
Why should I gain from his reward?
D                    A
I cannot give an answer
D                                   G
But this I know with all my heart:
D                            A  D
his wounds have paid my ransom

[End]
D                                   G
