# Indescribable

[Verse 1]
C#m                                 Bsus/D#     E   E2
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
F#m              F#m7/E             D
Creation's revealing Your majesty
C#m                              Bsus/D#      E      E2
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
F#m                           F#m7/E           D
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
A     B
All exclaiming

[Chorus]
E                    Bsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
A2                                              C#m
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                   A2
You are amazing God
E  E2           Bsus
All powerful, untameable,
A2                                             C#m
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
E/G#             A2
You are amazing God

[Verse 2]
C#m                                Bsus/D#         E   E2
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
F#m                    F#m7/E                 D
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
C#m                              Bsus/D#         E     E2
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
F#m                        F#m7/E                 D
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
A        B
None can fathom

[Chorus] x2
E                    Bsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
A2                                                    C#m
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                         A2
You are amazing God
E     E2             Bsus
All powerful, untameable,
A2                                             C#m
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
E/G#             A2
You are amazing God
E                    Bsus
Incomparable, unchangeable
A2                                                  C#m
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
E/G#               A2
You are amazing God
                 A2
You are amazing God
