# Trust and Obey

[Verse 1]
D             A7  D
When we walk with the Lord
A7              D
In the light of His Word
G             D                   A   A7
What a glory He sheds on our way
D         A7    D
While we do His good will
A7                 D
He abides with us still
G                D            A7 D
And with all who will trust and, o-bey

[Refrain]
A7             D
Trust and obey
B7          Em
For there's no other way
A7           D
To be happy in Jesus
A7         A7 D
But to trust and o-bey

D C# Bm A G A A

[Verse 2]
D            A7 D
Not a shadow can rise,
A7               D
Not a cloud in the skies,
G                   D            A   A7
But his smile quickly drives it away,-
D            A7 D
Not a doubt nor a fear,
A7             D
Not a sigh nor a tear
G                    D        A7 D
Can abide while we trust and obey.

**REFRAIN**

[Verse 3]
D         A7  D
Not a burden we bear,
A7             D
Not a sorrow we share,
G                D          A  A7
But our toil he doth richly repay;
D           A7 D
Not a grief nor a loss,
A7               D
Not a frown nor a cross,
G              D             A7 D
But is blest if we trust and obey.

**REFRAIN**

[Verse 4]
D        A7  D
But we never can prove
A7                D
The delights of His love
G             D            A  A7
Until all on the altar we lay
D      A7 D
For the favor He shows
A7              D
And the joy He bestows
G                   D            A7 D
Are for them who will trust and o-bey

**REFRAIN**

[Verse 5]
D       A7  D
Then in fellowship sweet
A7           D
We will sit at His feet
G                D               A  A7
Or we'll walk by His side in the way
D            A7  D
What He says we will do
A7                  D
Where He sends we will go
G              D           A7 D
Never fear, only trust and o-bey

**REFRAIN**
