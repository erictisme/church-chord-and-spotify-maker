# All The Poor And Powerless

[Verse 1]
C                       F
All the poor and powerless
        C                   F
And all the lost and lonely
        C                   F
All the thieves will come confess
        Am              G
And know that You are holy
        Am              G
And know that You are holy

[Chorus]
        C               F
And all will sing out hallelujah
        C               F
And we will cry out hallelujah

[Verse 2]
C                       F
All the hearts who are content
        C                   F
And all who feel unworthy
        C                   F
And all who hurt with nothing left
        Am              G
Will know that You are holy

**CHORUS**

[Bridge]
Am              F
Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
C               G
Go on and tell it to the masses
Am              F       G
That He is God (yeah)

Am              F
Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
C               G
Go on and tell it to the masses
Am              F       G
That He is God

**CHORUS**

[Tag]
        C               F
And we will cry out hallelujah
        C               F
And we will cry out hallelujah
        C
