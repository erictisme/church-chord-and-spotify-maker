# Just a Closer Walk

[Verse 1]
G        Gmaj7                              Am7   D7
I am weak but Thou art strong
Am7     D7                                   G
Jesus keep me from all wrong
              G7                      C  Am7
I'll be satisfied as long
            G     Em7      Am7      D7             G
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee

[Chorus]
G           Gmaj7                          Am7   D7
Just a closer walk with Thee
Am7           D7                           G
Grant it Jesus, it's my plea
              G7                                C  Am7
Daily walking close to Thee
             G  Em7    Am7      D7       G
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

[Verse 2]
G                    Gmaj7                            Am7   D7
Thru' this world of toil and snares
Am7 D7                                  G
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
                        G7                            C  Am7
Who with me my burden share?
                      G     Em 7      Am7     D7               G
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3]
G                    Gmaj7                 Am7   D7
When my feeble life is o'er
Am7              D7                           G
Time for me will be no more
                  G7                          C  Am7
On that bright eternal shore
              G     Em 7      Am7     D7              G
I will walk, dear Lord, close to Thee

**CHORUS**
