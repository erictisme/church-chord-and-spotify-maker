# O How Good It Is

[Intro]
C/E F C/G F C/E G C

[Verse 1]
C                              F            C
Oh how good it is when the family of God
F             C/E       Am               G
Dwells to-gether in Spirit in faith and uni-ty
C             C/E             F         C/G
Where the bonds of peace of ac-ceptance and love
F                C/E                G         C
Are the fruit of His presence here a-mong us

[Chorus]
G                             F               C
So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord
G                              F                 G
And with one heart we'll live out his word
C               C/E               F              C
Till the whole earth sees the Re-deemer has come
F                C/E                    G
For he dwells in the presence of his peo-ple

**INTRO**

[Verse 2]
C                   F         C
Oh how good it is on this journey we share
F              C/E       Am                  G
To re-joice with the happy and weep with those who mourn
C         C/E              F           C/G
For the weak find strength the af-flicted find grace
F         C/E           G    C
When we offer the blessing of be-long-ing

**CHORUS**

[Verse 3] SOFT
C                 F         C
Oh how good it is to em-brace his command
F          C/E        Am             G
To pr-fer one an-other for-give as he for-gives
C      C/E          F          C/G
When we live as one we all share in the love
F             C/E   F       G   C
Of the Son with the Father and the Spir-it

**CHORUS** x2
