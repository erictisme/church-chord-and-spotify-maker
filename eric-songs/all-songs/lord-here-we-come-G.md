# Lord Here We Come

CAPO 3

[Verse 1]
G                              Bm                         Em
Dragged her to your feet; Anger, mercy meet
Em/C
oh what anguish
G                         Bm                               Em
You are pure and holy; She was wasted lonely
Em/C
time stood still
G                         Bm                                    Em
Oh now can't you see; That hopeless her in me
Em/C
Cowed down and silenced
G                         Bm                                       Em
Dreading all those stones; Desperate, lost 'n alone
Em/C
O Lord have mercy

[Chorus]
G                      Bm                       Em
Lord, here we come; On bended knees
      C
O Glorious One
G                 Bm                       Em
In sweet surrender; To you O Lord
         C (Diamond)
O Exalted One

[Verse 2]
G                         Bm                           Em
By her side He stands; Writing in the sand
Em/C
Rescued her for life
G                         Bm                                Em
Who here has no sin? There was none but him
Em/C
No stone thrown, her way
G                       Bm                                     Em
O Lord now we see; The whole world's in need
Em/C
There's no one righteous
G                             Bm                                 Em
Thinking ourselves wise; Hearing our own lies
Em/C
O Lord have mercy

**CHORUS**
